{"input": "small non - coding rnas are transcribed into mrna but remain untranslated in eukaryotic cells . they include sirna ( small interfering rna ) , mirna ( microrna ) , pirna ( piwi - interacting rna ) and snorna ( small nucleolar rna ) . mirnas are a class of multifunctional singled - stranded small rna which are ~20  nt in length and regulate the stability or translational efficiency of targeted messenger rna depending on the base - pairing complementarity between the mirna and its target mrna [ 1 , 2 ] . although over 1,000 mirna sequences have been identified from the tissues or cells of human origin and other species , as many as 1,000 to 10,000 mirnas per genome have been predicted [ 3 , 4 ] . mirnas regulate a broad range of biological processes including timing of development , cell cycle progression , stem cell self - renewal , differentiation , cancer initiation , cancer cell proliferation , metastasis and apoptosis [ 511 ] . cancer is caused by multiple processes including uncontrolled cellular proliferation and inappropriate survival of apoptotic cells . many regulatory factors switch on or off genes that govern cell division and direct cellular proliferation . mirnas regulate gene expression and play important roles in the onset and progression of tumorigenesis . emerging evidence demonstrates the involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis , functioning either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes . although the current treatment of radiation therapy , chemotherapy and hormone therapy slow mammary gland tumor growth , prolong survival and improve the quality of patients life , metastatic breast cancer still remains incurable due to our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which tumorigenesis and metastasis occur . as small non - coding rnas regulate gene expression and tumorigenesis , they may represent a novel cancer therapy . unlike mrna , mirnas are transcribed but never translated . some mirnas are transcribed from non - coding regions between genes , deriving from independent transcription unit . other mirnas are transcribed together with coding mrnas from the coding region of the genome , deriving from the introns of gene transcripts [ 13 , 14 ] . mirna gene copy number gain / loss and mirna gene mutation have been observed in breast cancer resulting in the aberrant expression of mirna . the first study about the altered expression of mirnas in human breast cancer patients and human breast cancer cell lines was reported in 2005 by lorio et al . , in which 29 mirnas were identified with aberrant expression based on microarray and northern blot analysis of 76 breast tumor samples and 14 human breast cell lines . zhang and colleagues analyzed 283 human mirna genes on 55 human breast primary tumors and 18 human breast cancer cell lines using array - based comparative genomic hybridization . the results demonstrated a high frequency ( ~72.8% ) of gene copy number abnormality in mirna - containing regions in human breast cancer . wang et al . collected 68 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and examined the expression of selected mirnas in tumor and adjacent non - tumor tissues . mir-21 , mir-106a and mir-155 were significantly over - expressed in the tumor specimens compared with normal controls , whereas mir-126 , mir-199a and mir-335 were significantly decreased in expression in the tumor samples . our studies of the mir-17 - 92 cluster demonstrated decreased expression of mir-17/20 in human breast cancer specimens compared with matching normal breast tissue from the same patient . subsequent analysis identified reduced mir-17/20 expression in node - positive compared with node - negative breast cancers and demonstrated that mir-17/20 inhibited breast cancer cell migration and invasion via a heterotypic signaling . although the tendency for a global decrease of mirna expression in human cancers originally suggested a general tumor suppressor function of mirnas , subsequent studies showing the aberrant expression of specific mirnas in breast cancer suggest mirna - specific roles in breast cancer onset and progression . many distinct mirnas have been shown to regulate breast cancer cell proliferation , apoptosis , cancer stem cell expansion , and tumorigenesis . mirna may function as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes depending on the cell type , culture conditions , target genes and pathway . the involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis has been reviewed recently [ 21 , 22 ] . le et al . described the expression pattern and regulatory network of key mirnas in breast cancer , including let-7 , mir-34 , mir-125 , mir-200 family , mir-205 , mir-21 , mir-10 and the mir-17 - 92 cluster . adams et al . reviewed the mirna regulation of estrogen signaling pathway and erbb2/her signaling pathway in breast cancer . the understanding of how mirnas are involved in breast cancer through regulating the cell cycle remains rudimentary . herein we summarize the recent literature and research progress on the mechanism by which mirnas regulate the breast cancer cell cycle and cellular proliferation ( fig . 1mirna regulation of mammary gland tumorigenesis in control of the cell cycle . through targeting different genes and different cyclin / cdk complexes , mir-17/20 and let-7 regulate the g1-s transition ; mir-21 and mir-27a regulate the g2-m checkpoint mirna regulation of mammary gland tumorigenesis in control of the cell cycle . through targeting different genes and different cyclin / cdk complexes , mir-17/20 and let-7 regulate the g1-s transition ; mir-21 and mir-27a regulate the g2-m checkpoint cyclin d1 is either overexpressed or amplified in ~50% of breast cancer . the abundance of cyclin d1 is rate - limiting in breast cancer cellular proliferation and g1-s phase transition [ 23 , 24 ] . in addition , cyclin d1 is a critical downstream target of erbb2- , ras- and -catenin- induced breast cancers , and is sufficient for the induction of mammary tumors when targeted to the mammary gland of mice . antisense inhibition of cyclin d1 expression in vivo suppressed the growth of neut - transformed mammary adenocarcinoma cells in nude mice . conserved sequences of the cyclin d1 3utr contain potential binding sites for multiple mirnas including mir-17/20/106 , mir-15/16 , mir-23 and let-7 . mir-17/20 binds the cyclin d1 3utr , inhibiting the expression of cyclin d1 , resulting in cell cycle arrest at the g1 phase and suppression of mcf-7 cell proliferation [ 18 , 26 ] . the regulation of cyclin d1 expression by mir-17 - 92 , as well as mir-15/16 , was confirmed by deshpande et al . . the let-7 family functions as a tumor suppressor in a variety of cancers including lung , colon , ovarian   and breast cancer . schultz et al . demonstrated the downregulation of cyclin d1 by mirna let-7 in control of cancer cell growth . the regulation of cyclin d1 by mirna is likely of broad importance as cyclin d1 encodes the regulatory subunit of a kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates the prb family proteins to inhibit dna synthesis , and phosphorylates nuclear respiratory factor 1 ( nrf-1 ) to inhibit mitochondria biogenesis [ 32 , 33 ] . furthermore , cyclin d1 promotes breast epithelial cell angiogenesis and migration , and promotes chromosomal instability which in turn contributes to tumorigenesis . the mir-221/222 cluster regulates the cell cycle , cell growth and epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) in breast cancer . mir-221/222 inhibited p27 and p57 abundance , facilitating g1-s phase transition , thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation [ 36 , 37 ] . moreover , mir-221/222 may contribute to the aggressive clinical behavior of basal - like breast cancers . the breast cancer basal - like subtype - specific mirnas , mir-221 and mir-222 , promote emt in breast cancer by targeting trps1 ( trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 1 ) which inhibits emt by repressing zeb2 expression . mir-221 and/or mir-222 expression in mcf-7 and t47d breast cancer cells decreased er expression associated with tamoxifen resistance . the onco - mirna mir-21 is overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers including breast cancer [ 40 , 41 ] . mir-21 induced cellular proliferation , migration , invasion , emt , cancer stem cell characteristics and chemotherapy resistance in human breast cancer [ 42 , 43 ] . high mir-21 level is associated with poor prognosis , advanced stage , positive lymph node status and reduced survival time in breast cancer . mir-21 promotes mcf-7 cellular proliferation in part through inhibiting the expression of a tumor suppressor gene programmed cell death 4 ( pdcd4 ) . in colon cancer , mir-21 participates in a dna damage - induced g2-m checkpoint through suppressing the cell cycle regulator cdc25a . a recent report demonstrated the mir-21 regulates the cell cycle through targeting cdc25a in mcf-7 breast cancer cells . with a potential anti - cancer chemical 3,3-diindolylmethane treatment , mir-27a expression is upregulated in human breast cancer cell lines . in mda - mb-231 cells , mir-27a negatively regulated the zinc finger zbtb10 gene and myt-1 , thereby promoting breast cancer cell proliferation . mir-27a suppressed myt-1 , increased cdc2/cyclin b activity and promoted the g2-m checkpoint in mda - mb-231 cells . thus , distinct mirnas affect key genetic targets that govern distinct cell - cycle checkpoints including cyclins , cdks , cdk inhibitors and the g2-m regulation apparatus . in addition to cell - cycle control , breast tumor onset and progression and breast tumor stem cells are also regulated by distinct mirnas . cancer stem cells ( cscs ) are characterized by their self - renewal capacity , an ability to differentiate into non - tumorigenic cell progeny , and their ability to seed tumors when transplanted into animal hosts . cell surface markers such as cd44 , cd24 , cd133 , epithelial - specific antigen and aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 are frequently used to isolate and enrich cscs . the involvement of mirnas in regulating tumor formation by cscs or tumor - initiating cells ( t - ic ) has been widely investigated . let-7 expression is very low to undetectable level in embryonic stem cells ( es cells ) and increases with differentiation . a comparison of mirna expression between breast t - ic and non - t - ic demonstrated reduced let-7 expression in t - ic and increased abundance with differentiation . transduction of breast cscs with let-7 reduced the proportion of undifferentiated cells , inhibited cell proliferation , mammosphere formation , and tumor formation in vivo . clarke and colleagues identified 37 mirnas which were differentially expressed between human breast cscs ( cd44cd24lineage ) and lineage nontumorigenic breast cancer cells . the mir-200 family members were downregulated in human breast cscs and normal mammary stem / progenitor cells . expression of mir-200 inhibited breast cancer stem cell expansion in vitro , and suppressed the tumor formation ability of human breast cancer stem cell in vivo . ectopic mir-34c expression reduced breast t - ics self - renewal , inhibited emt and suppressed tumor cell invasiveness via silencing notch4 . zhu et al . found the reduced mir-128 expression in human breast t - ic was accompanied by bmi-1 and abcc5 overexpression , and associated with chemotherapeutic resistance and poor survival . enforced mir-128 expression increased the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to doxorubicin - induced apoptosis and dna damage . emerging evidence has demonstrated the importance of cscs in cancer initiation , cancer metastasis and drug resistance . cscs are believed to be one of the most promising targets for cure of cancer . the discovery that non - coding rnas regulate cscs widens our understanding of cscs , and may provide potential novel strategies for breast cancer therapy . deletion of chromosome 6q , including region 6q14-q16 , is frequently observed in breast cancer . the small non - coding snorna u50 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene in the 6q14 - 16 region , playing a role in the development and/or progression of breast cancer . genomic deletion and transcriptional downregulation of snorna u50 was detected in breast cancer cell lines . re - expression of snorna u50 inhibited colony formation of the human breast cancer cells hs578 t and mda - mb-231 . pirnas are small non - coding rna that form rna - protein complexes through interactions with piwi proteins . pirna was initially discovered in germ line cells , and considered as germ line - specific small rnas . emerging evidence indicates that pirna expression occurs in somatic cells [ 57 , 58 ] and piwil2 expression has been identified in human breast cancer cells . high - throughput deep sequencing identified a group of small rnas matching pirna sequences in human breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines . the study of these non - coding small rnas in human cancer is just starting . the identification of the expression signature of these non - coding small rnas in breast cancer subtypes , and an understanding of their functional significance to oncogene expression , tumor initiation and tumor cell metastasis may shed important new perspectives on the role of these non - coding small rnas in breast cancer . small non - coding rna - based diagnostic and therapeutic applications for human cancer are expected in the near future . although tumor - targeted delivery and local administration are still major challenges to the practical application of gene therapy for cancer , mirna - based cancer therapeutic approaches are being established and tested in animal models . synthetic mirna mimics or mirna expression vectors have been successfully applied to restore or overexpress mirna in vitro . chemically modified lna anti - sense mirna inhibitor and other approaches have been used to block mirna function in cells . kim et al . recently reported significant anti - tumor effect of virus - mediated delivery of mir-145 combined with 5-fu to treat breast cancer . intranasal delivery of let-7   and intravenous delivery of mir-34a mimics   for non - small - cell lung cancer treatment and a virus - mediated delivery of mir-26a for liver cancer treatment in mouse model   demonstrate the promise of mirna for treatment of cancer . dysregulated expression of mirnas has implicated components of the non - coding genome as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors of breast cancer . experimental evidence has shown specific mirnas regulating the initiation , progression , metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancer via control of the cell cycle , altering cellular proliferation , altering cellular apoptosis and/or controlling the population of tumor stem cells . dysregulated mirna expression has also been observed in cancer associated fibroblasts ( caf ) and in the systemic circulation [ 65 , 66 ] . the circulating mirnas have the potential to serve as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer . a specific subset of dysregulated mirnas in breast cancer cells may serve as targets for gene therapy either alone or as an adjuvant treatment to current clinical protocols for breast cancer patients .", "output": "**Objective:** The main research question of this study is to investigate the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of breast cancer cell cycle and cellular proliferation, and to explore their potential as novel cancer therapy.\n\n**Background:** Breast cancer is a complex disease caused by multiple processes, including uncontrolled cellular proliferation and inappropriate survival of apoptotic cells. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and play important roles in the onset and progression of tumorigenesis.

{"input": "anxiety affects quality of life in those living with parkinson 's disease ( pd ) more so than overall cognitive status , motor deficits , apathy , and depression [ 13 ] . although anxiety and depression are often related and coexist in pd patients , recent research suggests that anxiety rather than depression is the most prominent and prevalent mood disorder in pd [ 5 , 6 ] . yet , our current understanding of anxiety and its impact on cognition in pd , as well as its neural basis and best treatment practices , remains meager and lags far behind that of depression . overall , neuropsychiatric symptoms in pd have been shown to be negatively associated with cognitive performance . for example , higher depression scores have been correlated with lower scores on the mini - mental state exam ( mmse ) [ 8 , 9 ] as well as tests of memory and executive functions ( e.g. , attention ) [ 1014 ] . likewise , apathy and anhedonia in pd patients have been associated with executive dysfunction [ 10 , 1523 ] . however , few studies have specifically investigated the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd . one study showed a strong negative relationship between anxiety ( both state and trait ) and overall cognitive performance ( measured by the total of the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status index ) within a sample of 27 pd patients . furthermore , trait anxiety was negatively associated with each of the cognitive domains assessed by the rbans ( i.e. , immediate memory , visuospatial construction , language , attention , and delayed memory ) . two further studies have examined whether anxiety differentially affects cognition in patients with left - sided dominant pd ( lpd ) versus right - sided dominant pd ( rpd ) ; however , their findings were inconsistent . the first study found that working memory performance was worse in lpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd patients with anxiety , whereas the second study reported that , in lpd , apathy but not anxiety was associated with performance on nonverbally mediated executive functions and visuospatial tasks ( e.g. , tmt - b , wms - iii spatial span ) , while in rpd , anxiety but not apathy significantly correlated with performance on verbally mediated tasks ( e.g. , clock reading test and boston naming test ) . furthermore , anxiety was significantly correlated with neuropsychological measures of attention and executive and visuospatial functions . taken together , it is evident that there are limited and inconsistent findings describing the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd and more specifically how anxiety might influence particular domains of cognition such as attention and memory and executive functioning . it is also striking that , to date , no study has examined the influence of anxiety on cognition in pd by directly comparing groups of pd patients with and without anxiety while excluding depression . given that research on healthy young adults suggests that anxiety reduces processing capacity and impairs processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory [ 26 , 27 ] , we hypothesized that pd patients with anxiety would show impairments in attentional set - shifting and working memory compared to pd patients without anxiety . furthermore , since previous work , albeit limited , has focused on the influence of symptom laterality on anxiety and cognition , we also explored this relationship . seventeen pd patients with anxiety and thirty - three pd patients without anxiety were included in this study ( see table 1 ) . the cross - sectional data from these participants was taken from a patient database that has been compiled over the past 8 years ( since 2008 ) at the parkinson 's disease research clinic at the brain and mind centre , university of sydney . inclusion criteria involved a diagnosis of idiopathic pd according to the united kingdom parkinson 's disease society brain bank criteria   and were confirmed by a neurologist ( sjgl ) . patients also had to have an adequate proficiency in english and have completed a full neuropsychological assessment . ten patients in this study ( 5 pd with anxiety ; 5 pd without anxiety ) were taking psychotropic drugs ( i.e. , benzodiazepine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) . patients were also excluded if they had other neurological disorders , psychiatric disorders other than affective disorders ( such as anxiety ) , or if they reported a score greater than six on the depression subscale of the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) . thus , all participants who scored within a  depressed  ( hads - d > 6 ) range were excluded from this study , in attempt to examine a refined sample of pd patients with and without anxiety in order to determine the independent effect of anxiety on cognition . this research was approved by the human research ethics committee of the university of sydney , and written informed consent was obtained from all participants . self - reported hads was used to assess anxiety in pd and has been previously shown to be a useful measure of clinical anxiety in pd . a cut - off score of > 8 on the anxiety subscale of the hads ( hads - a ) was used to identify pd cases with anxiety ( pda+ ) , while a cut - off score of < 6 on the hads - a was used to identify pd cases without anxiety ( pda ) . this criterion was more stringent than usual ( > 7 cut - off score ) , in effort to create distinct patient groups . the neurological evaluation rated participants according to hoehn and yahr ( h&y ) stages   and assessed their motor symptoms using part iii of the revised mds task force unified parkinson 's disease rating scale ( updrs ) . in a similar way this was determined by calculating a total left and right score from rigidity items 3035 , voluntary movement items 3643 , and tremor items 5057 from the mds - updrs part iii ( see table 1 ) . processing speed was assessed using the trail making test , part a ( tmt - a , z - score ) . attentional set - shifting was measured using the trail making test , part b ( tmt - b , z - score ) . working memory was assessed using the digit span forward and backward subtest of the wechsler memory scale - iii ( raw scores ) . language was assessed with semantic and phonemic verbal fluency via the controlled oral word associated test ( cowat animals and letters , z - score ) . the ability to retain learned verbal memory was assessed using the logical memory subtest from the wechsler memory scale - iii ( lm - i z - score , lm - ii z - score , % lm retention z - score ) . the mini - mental state examination ( mmse ) demographic , clinical , and neuropsychological variables were compared between the two groups with the independent t - test or mann  whitney u test , depending on whether the variable met parametric assumptions . chi - square tests were used to examine gender and symptom laterality differences between groups . all analyses employed an alpha level of p < 0.05 and were two - tailed . spearman correlations were performed separately in each group to examine associations between anxiety and/or depression ratings and cognitive functions . as expected , the pda+ group reported significant greater levels of anxiety on the hads - a ( u = 0 , p < 0.001 ) and higher total score on the hads ( u = 1 , p < 0.001 ) compared to the pda group ( table 1 ) . groups were matched in age ( t(48 ) = 1.31 , p = 0.20 ) , disease duration ( u = 259 , p = 0.66 ) , updrs - iii score ( u = 250.5 , p = 0.65 ) , h&y ( u = 245 , p = 0.43 ) , ledd ( u = 159.5 , p = 0.80 ) , and depression ( hads - d ) ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.06 ) . additionally , all groups were matched in the distribution of gender (  = 0.098 , p = 0.75 ) and side - affected (  = 0.765 , p = 0.38 ) . there were no group differences for tmt - a performance ( u = 256 , p = 0.62 ) ( table 2 ) ; however , the pda+ group had worse performance on the trail making test part b ( t(46 ) = 2.03 , p = 0.048 ) compared to the pda group ( figure 1 ) . the pda+ group also demonstrated significantly worse performance on the digit span forward subtest ( t(48 ) = 2.22 , p = 0.031 ) and backward subtest ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.016 ) compared to the pda group ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) . neither semantic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.70 , p = 0.49 ) nor phonemic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.39 , p = 0.70 ) differed between groups . logical memory i immediate recall test ( u = 176 , p = 0.059 ) showed a trend that the pda+ group had worse new verbal learning and immediate recall abilities than the pda group . however , logical memory ii test performance ( u = 219 , p = 0.204 ) and logical memory % retention ( u = 242.5 , p = 0.434 ) did not differ between groups . there were also no differences between groups in global cognition ( mmse ) ( u = 222.5 , p = 0.23 ) . participants were split into lpd and rpd , and then further group differences were examined between pda+ and pda. importantly , the groups remained matched in age , disease duration , updrs - iii , dde , h&y stage , and depression but remained significantly different on self - reported anxiety . lpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span forward test ( t(19 ) = 2.29 , p = 0.033 ) compared to lpda , whereas rpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span backward test ( u = 36.5 , p = 0.006 ) , lm - i immediate recall ( u = 37.5 , p = 0.008 ) , and lm - ii ( u = 45.0 , p = 0.021 ) but not lm % retention ( u = 75.5 , p = 0.39 ) compared to rpda. this study is the first to directly compare cognition between pd patients with and without anxiety . the findings confirmed our hypothesis that anxiety negatively influences attentional set - shifting and working memory in pd . more specifically , we found that pd patients with anxiety were more impaired on the trail making test part b which assessed attentional set - shifting , on both digit span tests which assessed working memory and attention , and to a lesser extent on the logical memory test which assessed memory and new verbal learning compared to pd patients without anxiety . taken together , these findings suggest that anxiety in pd may reduce processing capacity and impair processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory in a similar way as seen in young healthy adults [ 26 , 27 ] . although the neurobiology of anxiety in pd remains unknown , many researchers have postulated that anxiety disorders are related to neurochemical changes that occur during the early , premotor stages of pd - related degeneration [ 37 , 38 ] such as nigrostriatal dopamine depletion , as well as cell loss within serotonergic and noradrenergic brainstem nuclei ( i.e. , raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus , resp . , which provide massive inputs to corticolimbic regions ) . over time , chronic dysregulation of adrenocortical and catecholamine functions can lead to hippocampal damage as well as dysfunctional prefrontal neural circuitries [ 39 , 40 ] , which play a key role in memory and attention . recent functional neuroimaging work has suggested that enhanced hippocampal activation during executive functioning and working memory tasks may represent compensatory processes for impaired frontostriatal functions in pd patients compared to controls . therefore , chronic stress from anxiety , for example , may disrupt compensatory processes in pd patients and explain the cognitive impairments specifically in working memory and attention seen in pd patients with anxiety . it has also been suggested that hyperactivation within the putamen may reflect a compensatory striatal mechanism to maintain normal working memory performance in pd patients ; however , losing this compensatory activation has been shown to contribute to poor working memory performance . anxiety in mild pd has been linked to reduced putamen dopamine uptake which becomes more extensive as the disease progresses . this further supports the notion that anxiety may disrupt compensatory striatal mechanisms as well , providing another possible explanation for the cognitive impairments observed in pd patients with anxiety in this study . noradrenergic and serotonergic systems should also be considered when trying to explain the mechanisms by which anxiety may influence cognition in pd . although these neurotransmitter systems are relatively understudied in pd cognition , treating the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems has shown beneficial effects on cognition in pd . selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , citalopram , was shown to improve response inhibition deficits in pd , while noradrenaline reuptake blocker , atomoxetine , has been recently reported to have promising effects on cognition in pd [ 45 , 46 ] . overall , very few neuroimaging studies have been conducted in pd in order to understand the neural correlates of pd anxiety and its underlying neural pathology . future research should focus on relating anatomical changes and neurochemical changes to neural activation in order to gain a clearer understanding on how these pathologies affect anxiety in pd . to further understand how anxiety and cognitive dysfunction are related , future research should focus on using advanced structural and function imaging techniques to explain both cognitive and neural breakdowns that are associated with anxiety in pd patients . research has indicated that those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who have more neuropsychiatric symptoms have a greater risk of developing dementia compared to those with fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms . future studies should also examine whether treating neuropsychiatric symptoms might impact the progression of cognitive decline and improve cognitive impairments in pd patients . previous studies have used pd symptom laterality as a window to infer asymmetrical dysfunction of neural circuits . for example , lpd patients have greater inferred right hemisphere pathology , whereas rpd patients have greater inferred left hemisphere pathology . thus , cognitive domains predominantly subserved by the left hemisphere ( e.g. , verbally mediated tasks of executive function and verbal memory ) might be hypothesized to be more affected in rpd than lpd ; however , this remains controversial . it has also been suggested that since anxiety is a common feature of left hemisphere involvement [ 48 , 49 ] , cognitive domains subserved by the left hemisphere may also be more strongly related to anxiety . results from this study showed selective verbal memory deficits in rpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd without anxiety , whereas lpd patients with anxiety had greater attentional / working memory deficits compared to lpd without anxiety . although these results align with previous research , interpretations of these findings should be made with caution due to the small sample size in the lpd comparison specifically . recent work has suggested that the hads questionnaire may underestimate the burden of anxiety related symptomology and therefore be a less sensitive measure of anxiety in pd [ 30 , 50 ] . in addition , our small sample size also limited the statistical power for detecting significant findings . based on these limitations , our findings are likely conservative and underrepresent the true impact anxiety has on cognition in pd . additionally , the current study employed a very brief neuropsychological assessment including one or two tests for each cognitive domain . future studies are encouraged to collect a more complex and comprehensive battery from a larger sample of pd participants in order to better understand the role anxiety plays on cognition in pd . another limitation of this study was the absence of diagnostic interviews to characterize participants ' psychiatric symptoms and specify the type of anxiety disorders included in this study . future studies should perform diagnostic interviews with participants ( e.g. , using dsm - v criteria ) rather than relying on self - reported measures to group participants , in order to better understand whether the type of anxiety disorder ( e.g. , social anxiety , phobias , panic disorders , and generalized anxiety ) influences cognitive performance differently in pd . one advantage the hads questionnaire provided over other anxiety scales was that it assessed both anxiety and depression simultaneously and allowed us to control for coexisting depression . although there was a trend that the pda+ group self - reported higher levels of depression than the pda group , all participants included in the study scored < 6 on the depression subscale of the hads . controlling for depression while assessing anxiety has been identified as a key shortcoming in the majority of recent work . considering many previous studies have investigated the influence of depression on cognition in pd without accounting for the presence of anxiety and the inconsistent findings reported to date , we recommend that future research should try to disentangle the influence of anxiety versus depression on cognitive impairments in pd . considering the growing number of clinical trials for treating depression , there are few if any for the treatment of anxiety in pd . anxiety is a key contributor to decreased quality of life in pd and greatly requires better treatment options . moreover , anxiety has been suggested to play a key role in freezing of gait ( fog ) , which is also related to attentional set - shifting [ 52 , 53 ] . future research should examine the link between anxiety , set - shifting , and fog , in order to determine whether treating anxiety might be a potential therapy for improving fog .", "output": "**Objective:** The main research question of this study is to investigate the impact of anxiety on cognition in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), specifically examining attentional set-shifting and working memory.\n\n**Background:** Anxiety is a common and prominent mood disorder in PD, but its impact on cognition is not well understood. Previous studies have shown that anxiety can reduce processing capacity and impair processing efficiency, especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory.\n\n**Methods:** This cross-sectional study included 17 PD patients with anxiety and 33 PD patients without anxiety.

{"input": "congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( cah ) refers to a group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by an enzyme deficiency which leads to defects in biosynthesis of steroid precursors . depending on the severity and degree of 21 hydroxylase deficiency , the clinical spectrum may vary from mild form of non classical cah to classic cah . however , the non classical cah variant is more common with a prevalence rate of 1 in 1000 . it also helps in maintaining normal levels of precursors by suppressing adreno cortico trophic hormone ( acth ) . during childhood , the management is largely focused on achieving normal growth and attaining appropriate final adult height . johns medical college hospital , bangalore by the department of endocrinology on patients diagnosed to have cah and seen in the outpatient clinic between january 2012 and october 2012 . during this period data regarding demography , clinical presentation at time of diagnosis , treatment details , height sds and bmi were collected . all patients underwent biochemical testing for 17 hydroxy progesterone ( 17 ohp ) levels for assessment of adequacy of therapy . bone age assessment with left hand and wrist bmi was calculated for all patients and obesity was defined using who charts as values above 95th percentile . 17 ohp levels between 1 ng / ml and 12 ng / ml were considered appropriate ; values below 1 ng / ml suggested suppression and over treatment and values above 12 ng / ml suggested under treatment . 29 patients were included in the study of which 22 were females ( 76% ) and 7 were males ( 24% ) . based on the cross sectional data collected , 11 patients were adults ( age > 18 ) and 18 patients were children ( 62% ) . among the males , one child was identified at birth via a neonatal screening program , one child presented with early pubarche , the other 5 infants presented between their 3rd and 6th week of life with features suggestive of adrenal crisis - poor feeding , vomiting and failure to gain weight . one of the male patients incidentally also had a penoscrotal hypospadias which was surgically corrected . among the females , 9 infants were identified at birth due to presence of genital ambiguity ( 40% ) , 1 presented with symptoms of adrenal crisis at 4 weeks of life , 4 patients presented in the pre pubertal period due to early onset adrenarche ( 18% ) , 5 patients presented in the late adolescent period with marked virilization ( 23% ) and 3 patients presented with features of poly cystic ovarian disease ( pcos ) . all the five patients who presented in the late adolescent period had obvious genital ambiguity from birth , however , they sought medical attention only much later due to marked virilization and failure to attain menarche . one among them had actually been evaluated and even underwent a clitoroplasty at a young age , but unfortunately , the diagnosis of cah was missed as she was mistakenly categorized as probable ovo testicular dsd due to presence of mullerian structures with a phallic length of around 6 cm . all these 5 women had a masculine built at presentation with poor breast development , severe hirsutism , muscular body habitus , temporal balding and varying degrees of deepening of voice . the non classical cah ( nccah ) patients presented in adulthood with complaints of irregular cycles and hirsutism ; they had no features of virilisation . simple virilizing was the most common sub class seen among the women ( 81% ) whereas the salt wasting type was predominant among boys ( 85% ) . around 35% of patients had short stature as defined by height sds < -2.0 ; 2 patients who presented with adrenarche had increase in height sds , however , their bone age was also correspondingly advanced . all the children were treated with hydrocortisone ; almost all adult patients were on dexamethasone . none of the nccah patients were treated with glucocorticoids ; they were on anti - androgen therapy along with oral contraceptive pills . most adult classic cah patients with complaints of hirsutism were treated with either spironolactone or finasteride . pubertal induction with ethinyl estradiol was initiated for three of the adult patients who sought medical care late . analysis of 17 ohp levels revealed that 32% were suppressed with levels less than 1ng / ml ; appropriate in 47% and inadequate in 21% of patients . we report the phenotypic features of a cohort of patients with cah being evaluated and managed in a tertiary centre in southern india . in this series , the typical presentation of male babies were with adrenal crisis between the 3 and 6 week of life . around 20% of female patients with classic cah were identified and appropriately treated only after late adolescence even when genital ambiguity was present since birth . short stature was seen in one third of patients on therapy and the average final adult height among patients with classic cah was 142.37 , which was significantly lower than the mean adult height for females in our population . the mean final adult height of 157.5 cm for those with nccah was better than their classic cah counterpart . obesity and hypertension were not found to be significantly higher in this cohort of cah patients . one third of patients had suppressed 17 ohp levels suggestive of over replacement therapy which may also contribute to the reduction in the final adult stature .", "output": "**Objective:** The main research question of the study is to evaluate the phenotypic features, management, and outcomes of patients with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) in a tertiary center in southern India.\n\n**Background:** CAH is a group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by an enzyme deficiency, leading to defects in steroid precursor biosynthesis. The study aims to understand the clinical spectrum, management, and outcomes of CAH patients in a specific population.\n\n**Methods:** The study is a cross-sectional analysis of 29 patients (22 females, 7 males) diagnosed with CAH and seen in the outpatient clinic between January 2012 and October 2012. Data on demography, clinical presentation, treatment details, height SDS, BMI, and biochemical testing for 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) levels were collected.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* The typical presentation of male babies was with adrenal crisis between 3-6 weeks of life, while female patients often presented with genital ambiguity at birth or later with symptoms of virilization.\n* Short stature was seen in one-third of patients on therapy, with a mean final adult height of 142.37 cm for classic CAH patients, significantly lower than the mean adult height for females in the population.\n* One-third of patients had suppressed 17-OHP levels, suggesting over-replacement therapy, which may contribute to reduced final adult stature.\n* Obesity and hypertension were not significantly higher in this cohort of CAH patients.\n\n**Conclusions:** The study highlights the importance of early diagnosis and management of CAH to prevent long-term complications, such as short stature and virilization.

{"input": "the family is the cornerstone of human social support network and its presence is essential in everyone s life . changes inevitably occur in families with illness and hospitalization of a family member . in other words , among the sources of stress for families are accidents leading to hospitalization particularly intensive care unit ( icu ) . statistics show that 8% of hospital beds in the united states are occupied by the intensive care units . stress in the family while the patient is in the icu can disrupt the harmony power of the family members and finally , it may causes disturbances in the support of the patient . in addition to the various sources of stress in intensive care units such as the patient s fear of death , financial problems , lack of awareness about the environment and etc . , their satisfaction level is another important source of stress for the patient s family . today , the family needs of hospitalized patients in the icu are summarized in five sections . these factors may include receiving assurance , staying close to the patient , receiving information , feeling comfortable and receiving support . however , in many cases , the patient s family needs and their expectations in the icu will not be fulfilled which will cause dissatisfaction . since , how families deal with mental stress is the most important components of comprehensive care , it should be known that attention to the family needs of the patients hospitalized in intensive care units could increase their satisfaction and thus a reduction in stress disorders . studies showed that the nurses in particular sections focus primarily on the patient and the disease . therefore , attention to the families should be considered as an important part in patient management . effective interventions targeted at the needs and expectations of family members should help to reduce the stress and improve their satisfaction . fox et al . stated that the needs of the family members were not often overlooked by the nurses . however , the nurses spend a lot of time with the patients and their families and are in a good position to assess their needs and plan for meeting these needs with appropriate interventions . the reason of investigating the satisfaction of the families of the patients in the icu is that the patients are facing life - threatening illness experiences and complex treatments , different technologies and different equipment are used for them . these cases could potentially lead to the dissatisfaction of their families . in the meantime , the families of trauma and neurosurgical patients are more vulnerable than the other groups of patients . they need supports that are more emotional and should be accepted by the icu staff . today , there are many theories expressed that in intensive care units , the patient and his family should be considered as a single unit . by providing care to this unit , the aim of this study was to analyze the satisfaction of the families of icu patients . the tool of society of critical care medicine s family needs assessment ( sccmfna ) ( which has been validated in 1998 by johnson ) was used in that study . the results showed that most of the family satisfaction was related to the communication and patient care and the lowest level of satisfaction was about the ability of staff to patients family comfort . bailey et al . have conducted a study in 2009 with the purpose of investigating the relationship between informational support to families of special care patients and their anxiety and satisfaction . they showed that there is a direct link between the informational support and their satisfaction . the study of fumis et al . in 2008 also showed that the increase in the availability of physicians for giving the information to the patient s family and as well as nurses efforts to provide understandable explanations about the patient s condition to them will increase the patient s family satisfaction . this clinical trial was performed with respect to the existing gap for a study carried out for investigating the interventions for the satisfaction of the patients in the special care units and their families in iran . the purpose of the study was to determine the effectiveness of nursing interventions based on family needs on family satisfaction level of hospitalized patients in the neurosurgery intensive care unit of al - zahra hospital in 2010 . the statistical research community was the families of hospitalized patients in neurosurgery intensive care unit of al - zahra ( sa ) hospital , isfahan , iran from may to september 2010 . with respect to inclusion criteria , the families of 64 patients were selected with simple sampling . after obtaining the informed consents from the hospitalized patients , by using the envelopes , which were prepaid by using a table of random numbers , they were divided into two groups ( intervention and control ) . the inclusion criteria was included as the following cases : to be a first - degree member of the family , to be older than 18 years , willing to participate in the study , having the power to speak and write in farsi , to be hospitalized one day before the study , lack of physical or mental problem in the family member , no responsibility for the care of another patient , introduced as the first person responsible for the patient care . obtaining the written informed consent , completion of the questionnaires about demographic information and the families satisfaction were performed in the second day of hospitalization of the patients in icu in both groups . johnson questionnaire for the satisfaction of the family of icu patients was used to measure the family satisfaction . the rating of the questionnaire was performed by using the likert scale with four options of 0 to 4 as follows : almost all the time ( 3 scores ) , often ( 2 scores ) , only occasionally ( 1 score ) and never ( zero score ) . johnson s questionnaire was the modified type of multer patient s family needs , which was evaluated in various scientific researches and there are extensive evidences for its validity . the interventions were performed in the second and the third day of hospitalization of the patient in the neurosurgery icu by the researcher in the morning shift for the intervention group . thus , the researcher provided understandable explanations about the disease to the patient s family and answered honestly to the questions about the patient and the disease . the researcher ensured them for providing the best care in the section and spoke about the prognosis of the disease . the researcher took the family member to the patient s room and gave the necessary information about the room space , equipment , personnel departments and the actions that were done for the patient . the patient family member was contacted if there was a change in the patient condition . they let the family help the patient in some cases of the public health ( such as hand and foot massage and giving food ) . locations of rest , nutrition , prayer room , bathroom and buffet of the hospital were introduced to them . the telephone numbers of hospitals and wards ( and if necessary , the social worker and supervisor ) were given . various departments and personnel of the hospital were taught to accept the families and communicate with them . the hospital social worker was introduced and if necessary , the patient s family was allowed to express their feelings . these interventions were performed in the evening shift of the second and the third day of the patient reception . the actions were carried out by the fellow researcher . while , for the control group , only the routine work was done . on the fourth day , the satisfaction survey was completed by the selected family member in both of the intervention and control groups . statistical methods used in this study were 2 test , man - whitney , independent student s t - test and paired t - tests . the findings did not show statistically significant difference in the demographic characteristics of the intervention and control groups , such as : age ( p < 0.99 ) , gender ( p < 0.79 ) , marital status ( p < 0.41 ) , educational level ( p < 0.12 ) and relation with patient ( p < 0.54 ) . as shown in table 1 , there was no significant difference in the mean satisfaction score before the intervention in the intervention and control groups ( p > 0.05 ) . the mean satisfaction score after the intervention in the intervention group was significantly more than the control group ( p < 0.001 ) . the mean satisfaction score in the intervention group after the intervention was significantly higher than before the intervention ( p < 0.001 ) . there was no significant difference in the mean satisfaction score in the control group before and after the intervention ( p > 0.05 ) ( table 2 ) . comparison of mean satisfaction score ( 100 * ) of participants in the intervention and control groups the mean of satisfaction score changes of the studied subjects in the intervention and control groups after intervention the results of the present study showed that the nursing interventions based on the family needs increased the patient s family satisfaction in the neurosurgery intensive care unit of al - zahra hospital . due to the differences in the study design , study population , the number of samples and methods of intervention , it would be difficult to compare the results . in chien et al . study , the results showed that performing the training based on the patients family needs in the icu , decreased the anxiety and increased their satisfaction . in the study of myhren et al . indicated that effective communication of the staff with the families of icu patients would increase their satisfaction . in the study by rosher and robinson , it showed that involving the families in patient care led to increase their satisfaction than before the intervention . the mentioned results were consistent with the results of this study , because all of these interventions were some parts of the interventions performed in this study . however , the study of steele et al . indicated that clinical training had no impact on the family satisfaction of the patient hospitalized in the icu . therefore , there was no statistically significant difference in the satisfaction level in the control and intervention group . in this study , it was shown that the use of nursing interventions based on family needs ( confidence , support , information , proximity and convenience ) had significant impact on the family satisfaction of the patient hospitalized in intensive care unit . they should be based on the family investigation and recognition and their priority needs should be determined in order to cause the greatest satisfaction . the icu nurses must also accept their role in the care of patient s family members . the findings of this study could be a basis for performing further studies about family needs of the patients in the icu especially with the different forms of culture and economy . consequently , the increase in family satisfaction of patients can reduce the stress disorders and improve their mental state and ultimately better support of the patient by the family . this study only examined the effect of nursing interventions in the first days of hospitalization on the satisfaction of the families but the effects on the patient s entire hospitalization period has not been assessed . by performing other researches in this field , it would be possible to compare the differences in the effects of nursing interventions based on the needs of families in the early days and the whole period of the patient s hospitalization .", "output": "**Objective:** The main research question of this study is to determine the effectiveness of nursing interventions based on family needs on family satisfaction levels of hospitalized patients in the neurosurgery intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n**Background:** The study highlights the importance of family support in the ICU, where patients are facing life-threatening illnesses and complex treatments. The presence of family members can be a source of stress, and their satisfaction levels can impact the patient's care and recovery. The study aims to investigate the impact of nursing interventions on family satisfaction in the ICU.\n\n**Methods:** This clinical trial was conducted in the neurosurgery ICU of Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan, Iran, from May to September 2010. The study population consisted of 64 families of hospitalized patients, who were divided into two groups (intervention and control) using simple random sampling. The intervention group received nursing interventions based on family needs, while the control group received routine care. The Johnson questionnaire was used to measure family satisfaction, and statistical methods such as t-tests and paired t-tests were used to analyze the data.\n\n**Key Findings:** The study found that the nursing interventions based on family needs significantly increased family satisfaction in the intervention group compared to the control group. The mean satisfaction score after the intervention was significantly higher in the intervention group than before the intervention. The study also found that the interventions had a positive impact on family satisfaction, particularly in terms of communication, patient care, and staff support.\n\n**Conclusions:** The study concludes that nursing interventions based on family needs can increase family satisfaction in the ICU. The findings suggest that ICU nurses should prioritize family needs and provide interventions that address these needs, such as providing information, support, and comfort. The study also highlights the importance of family-centered care in the ICU.\n\n**Clinical Relevance:** The study's findings have implications for medical practice and patient care in the ICU. By prioritizing family needs and providing interventions that address these needs, ICU nurses can improve family satisfaction, reduce stress disorders, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

{"input": "development of human societies and industrialization as well as changes in stress sources has changed disease pattern in civilized societies . as a result , the disease pattern has changed from traditional diseases such as infectious diseases and malnutrition to diseases such as heart disease , diabetes , accidents and so forth . among them coronary artery disease is the most cardiovascular disorder as a health problem in developing and developed countries . in fact , this is not only a chronic disease associated with high mortality , but it causes limitations in life and disability in a large part of the productive forces of the country . it is also associated with reduced production and increased medical costs [ 3 - 5 ] . nowadays , cardiovascular diseases are among the most widespread chronic diseases in most countries . according to forecasts , the mortality rate in eastern mediterranean countries including iran will be 30 - 35% [ 6 , 7 ] . despite the emphasis on prevention and development of newtreatments , surgery is the only choice for many patients with cardiovascular disease . one of the surgical procedures for the treatment of cardiovascular patients is coronary artery bypass surgery . in fact , heart surgery significantly influences on the quality of life of patients with cardiovascular diseases . hence , heart surgery is an important event in the lives of patients causing collapse of economic , professional and personal life . on the other hand , each surgical procedure is associated with several psychological complications for patients . of the most important complications are anxiety and depression so that approximately 65% of cardiovascular patients experience them after surgical and medical interventions . in fact , anxiety and depression complicate the treatment process [ 7 , 8 ] . some scientists believe that anxiety is one of the essential elements of human life . however , acute and long - term anxiety is integral part of all psychological diseases . according to nemati and colleagues , in fact , anxiety is a common psychological response of cardiovascular patients which is associated with reduced quality of life and psychological morbidity [ 11 , 12 ] . on the other hand , anxiety causes increased heart rate and breathing as well as high blood pressure and even mortality . it is associated with increased risk of mortality , disability , increased medical care and functional impairment in daily activities [ 12 , 13 ] . clinical depression has been reported in 54% of patients after bypass surgery . according to world health organization ( who ) , depression is the fourth chronic disease where its disability is comparable with 8 major chronic disorders . the outcome of depression in patients with cardiovascular disease is deterioration of physical and emotional state . given the incidence of such complications in patients with cardiovascular disease the best practice in this area is appropriate communication with patient [ 13 , 15 ] . good and effective communication is very valuable from the perspective of patients . in general , communication is a set of learning skills . in fact , poor communication is the cause of most problems in treatment of patients . in fact , communication at the bedside is a therapeutic and professional communication . in health professionals , communication and communication skills play a very important role in satisfaction of patients and solving their problems . this is more important , especially in patients with chronic diseases or those requiring long - term care . the therapeutic communication is formed from the first encounter of the patient with the medical team [ 21 , 22 ] . however , studies have shown that the communication between patient and medical team is not efficient . the health personnel don not have adequate communication skills . in fact , nursing and medical team spend very little time to communicate with patients . accordingly , patients are not often satisfied with received information as well as the level and method of communication . hence , to achieve best therapeutic results , special attention should be paid to communication [ 16 , 19 , 22 ] . since nursing is a practical discipline based on professional knowledge , it is necessary to use knowledge infrastructure to develop new approaches in clinical practice . theories proposed by nursing scientists can be useful in this area [ 16 , 19 , 23 ] . for this purpose the nurse - patient communication is an essential element of this theory [ 21 , 24 ] . according to peplau theory , the purpose of nursing care is to achieve a common good nurse - patient communication . according to peplau , peplau refers to the importance of therapeutic communication with patients and its important role in reducing anxiety [ 21 , 23 , 24 ] . in fact , this theory provides a framework for nurse - patient communication . following this framework , the nurse will be able to respond communication needs of patients through establishing a good therapeutic communication with the patient [ 16 , 19 , 23 ] . hospitalization and a complex surgery such as heart surgery is a stressful process leading to depression in patients . furthermore , the need for security and psychological comfort is one of the basic needs of patients achieved through a proper structured therapeutic communication with low cost . accordingly , the objective of the present study is to examine the impact of peplau therapeutic communication model on anxiety and depression in patients who were candidate for coronary bypass surgery . this is a clinical trial with pre / post testing scheme examined the impact of independent variable ( peplau therapeutic communication ) on the dependent variables ( anxiety and depression ) . the population consisted of all patients who were candidates for coronary artery bypass referred to the research environment on non - emergency basis . the research environment was al - zahra heart hospital in shiraz due to the easy access to subjects and sufficient number of patients . data were collected using the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( kanter et al . ) . the reliability and validity of the scale have been studied by montazeri et al in 2003 . an internal consistency of 78% and 86% was respectively calculated for anxiety and depression using cronbach 's alpha . there are 14 four - option questions , each with a score of zero to 3 . odd and even questions are used to measure anxiety and depression , respectively ( seven questions to assess anxiety and seven questions to assess depression ) . a score of zero to 21 is given to each patient based on responses in each area ( a score of zero - seven : normal , eight-10 : moderate and > 10 : disease ) . due to the lack of access to error rate to calculate the sample size , 10 patients were selected as pilot ( with a depression and anxiety score of 10 or more based on the hospital anxiety and depression scale ) . after performing tests , the subjects were randomly divided into test and control groups ( using a coin ( toss ) ) . z12+z12s12+s22x1x22 the inclusion criteria were : being in a bypass list , having moderate to severe depression and anxiety scores , no history of mental illness , interesting in participating in the study ( i.e. the tendency of the patient and his family to participate in the intervention ) , lack of previous bypass surgery , aged between 35 and 70 years , ability to communicate verbally and ability to speak persian . the exclusion criteria included : lack of cooperation of patients and families during the intervention , failure to perform coronary artery bypass surgery for various reasons , mortality during the study , failure to attend therapeutic communication sessions ( at least the absence in two sessions ) . therapeutic communication sessions were held for the intervention group based on peplau 's model at four stages including : orientation , identification , exploitation and resolution . in total , seven sessions were held individually with the consent of the patient and his family at the hospital and patient 's home . it should be notedthat during therapeutic communication , duration of each session was variable given the location and patient 's needs . the place of each meeting was determined with the consent of the patient . at all meetings , the researcher used verbal and nonverbal communication skills to communicate with patients . to ensure the correct application of therapeutic communication skills , a self - control researcher - made tool approved by experts was used . the depression and anxiety of patients in both groups were assessed using the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) at baseline and then two and four months after surgery . the obtained data were analyzed using descriptive statistics as well as covariance analysis with the help of spss 16 . this study was approved by the ethics committee of the jondi shapoor medical university of ahvaz with rec.1392.58 code . the ethical issues considered in this study include an adequate explanation for the patients and their permission to participate in the study , the lack of any compulsion for patients to participate in the study , refusing to disclose secrets or private matters of patients and confidentiality of information , announcing the results without names and personal details . furthermore , the present study was registered with the irct2013072214110n1 code in clinical trial center ( irct.ir ) . this study was approved by the ethics committee of the jondi shapoor medical university of ahvaz with rec.1392.58 code . the ethical issues considered in this study include an adequate explanation for the patients and their permission to participate in the study , the lack of any compulsion for patients to participate in the study , refusing to disclose secrets or private matters of patients and confidentiality of information , announcing the results without names and personal details . furthermore , the present study was registered with the irct2013072214110n1 code in clinical trial center ( irct.ir ) . the percentage of male and female patients in the intervention group was 70.3% and 29.7% , respectively . the percentage of males and females in the control group was 51.4% and 48.6% , respectively . the status of the underlying disease was depicted in both intervention and control groups . according to results , the majority of patients were suffering from high blood pressure in both groups with a high frequency of 35.1% ( table 1 ) . as shown in table 2 , anxiety was reduced in the intervention group , while postoperative anxiety in the control group was increased . the hospital anxiety in the intervention group this indicates the role of peplau 's therapeutic communication in reducing hospital anxiety of patients . analysis of covariance was used to determine the effect of peplau 's therapeutic communication on anxiety level of the subjects . since hospital anxiety scale was used to measure anxiety , analysis of variance was performed using hospital anxiety scores . the results showed significant differences between experimental and control groups in terms of anxiety level immediately after surgery , two and four months after surgery after adjustment for post - test scores by eliminating the effect of pre - test . adjusted mean anxiety scores suggest that anxiety in the intervention group was lower than the control group . in fact , the mean anxiety scores of patients in the intervention group in pre - test and post - test stages represent the independent role of peplau 's therapeutic communication model in reducing anxiety in the intervention group ( f=174.02 , p=0.000 ) . moreover , the anxiety level in the intervention group two and four months after the intervention was decreased compared to the control group ( f=38.37 , p=0.000 ; f=11.58 , p=0.000 ) ( table 3 ) . as shown in table 4 , the mean depression in the intervention group was reduced after the surgery . the mean postoperative depression in the control group was increased . in fact , the hospital depression in the intervention group was reduced after the therapeutic communication . this indicates that the role of peplau 's therapeutic communication model in reducing hospital depression . analysis of covariance was used to determine the effect of peplau 's therapeutic communication on depression level of the subjects . since hospital depression scale was used to measure depression , analysis of variance was performed using hospital depression scores . the results showed significant differences between experimental and control groups in terms of depression level immediately after surgery , two and four months after surgery after adjustment for post - test scores by eliminating the effect of pre - test . adjusted mean depression scores suggest that anxiety in the intervention group was lower than the control group . in fact , the mean depression scores of patients in the intervention group in pre - test and post - test indicate the independent role of peplau 's therapeutic communication model in reducing depression in the intervention group ( f=163.27 , p=0.000 ) . such a difference is not observed in the control group . moreover , the depression level in the intervention group four months after the intervention was decreased compared to the control group ( f=20.58 , p=0.000 ) . however , no significant difference was found between two groups in terms of hospital depression two months after intervention ( p=0.61 ) ( table 5 ) . according to the results , peplau 's therapeutic communication is effective in reducing anxiety and depression in patients who were candidate for coronary artery bypass . it resulted in a dramatic decrease in anxiety and depression scores in the intervention group . depression and anxiety are the most important preventive factors in cardiovascular diseases   causing disease rejection by the patient and reduce the incentive to treat and increase the likelihood of disease recurrence [ 25 - 27 ] . most patients with coronary heart disease who survive after surgery resume their normal life after several weeks or several months . previous studies show that patients suffer from anxiety and depression several months and sometimes several years after the surgery [ 26 , 27 , 29 ] . therefore , follow - up and strategies to deal with postoperative psychological complications are of utmost importance . it is not possible except through establishing a coherent and targeted therapeutic communication . indeed , effective communication enables the medical team to identify patients needs and take steps to solve problems and meet their needs . according to dadashi , hosseini and moghaddam ( 2009 ) , staff had close encounters with patients in 85.5% of cases . according to mastaneh and mouseli ( 2013 ) , the rate of respecting patient rights in terms of communication was 60% indicating a moderate level of communication skills . on the other hand , duration and how to communicate with patients , particularly in dealing with patients with chronic diseases are essential in the hope and positive attitude to treatment and follow - up after discharge [ 29 - 31 ] . in fact , the patient gains motivation to cope with illness and trust in nurses through proper therapeutic communication , because the care of patients with either physical or mental illness requires correct and consistent communication [ 30 , 31 ] . therefore , implementing a communication pattern will help medical team to establish a proper communication . peplau 's model is one of these communication patterns . to communicate with patients , especially patients with chronic diseases , peplau 's described four stages and defined roles for the nurse at every step as someone who is in close relationship with the patient [ 16 , 23 ] . peplau 's communication model helps nurses and patient to identify the disease , concerns and questions of the patient . through defining different roles for the nurse this model refers to nursing skills and abilities to establish a simple convenient therapeutic communication . the model enables nurses help the patient after discharge and to spend more time with patient [ 16 , 23 , 24 ] . for example , it has been used in communicating with cancer patients and solving systematic problems of families [ 32 , 33 ] . in this study , peplau 's communication models were employed as communication sessions for patients who were candidates for coronary artery bypass through applying nursing roles . the results showed that holding communication meetings with patients immediately after surgery dramatically reduced hospital anxiety and depression . accordingly , to improve the nurse - patient communication and establish more effective therapeutic communication processes which improves clinical basis and can have a positive impact on the treatment and discharge processes and rehabilitation of patients , especially in patients with chronic diseases , training courses should be included in in - service courses to train and introduce medical team with simple and inexpensive communication skills . furthermore , there is evidence that workshops on communication skills for health team can improve health outcomes and satisfaction of patients . another limitation of this study is the lower percentage of females ( 29.7% ) in the intervention group with respect to the control group ( 51.4% ) . the lower anxiety score in the intervention group could be due to therapeutic communication but also to gender differences . to write this article not contributed any financial resources and costs are the responsibility of the authors . all rights of this article reserved is owned by the ahvaz jundishapur university of medical sciences .", "output": "**Objective:** The main research question of this study is to examine the impact of Peplau's therapeutic communication model on anxiety and depression in patients who are candidates for coronary artery bypass surgery.\n\n**Background:** The disease pattern has changed from traditional diseases such as infectious diseases and malnutrition to diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and accidents. Coronary artery disease is the most common cardiovascular disorder and is associated with high mortality, limitations in life, and disability. Anxiety and depression are common complications in patients with cardiovascular disease, and effective communication is essential in reducing these complications.\n\n**Methods:** This is a clinical trial with a pre/post-testing scheme that examined the impact of Peplau's therapeutic communication model on anxiety and depression in patients who were candidates for coronary artery bypass surgery. The population consisted of all patients who were candidates for coronary artery bypass surgery referred to Al-Zahra Heart Hospital in Shiraz.

The intervention group received therapeutic communication sessions based on Peplau's model, while the control group did not receive any intervention.\n\n**Key Findings:** The results showed that Peplau's therapeutic communication model was effective in reducing anxiety and depression in patients who were candidates for coronary artery bypass surgery. The mean anxiety and depression scores in the intervention group were significantly lower than those in the control group. The results also showed that the therapeutic communication model was effective in reducing hospital anxiety and depression in the intervention group.\n\n**Conclusions:** The study concludes that Peplau's therapeutic communication model is effective in reducing anxiety and depression in patients who are candidates for coronary artery bypass surgery. The model provides a framework for nurse-patient communication and enables nurses to respond to the communication needs of patients.\n\n**Clinical Relevance:** The study's findings have implications for medical practice and patient care. Effective communication is essential in reducing anxiety and depression in patients with cardiovascular disease. The study suggests that training courses should be included in in-service courses to train and introduce medical teams with simple and inexpensive communication skills. Additionally, workshops on communication skills for health teams can improve health outcomes and patient satisfaction.", "topic": "Therapeutic communication", "cat": []}
{"input": "male macroprolactinomas ( mprl ) are usually revealed by headaches , visual troubles and gonadal insufficiency . suppurative meningitis ( sm ) , a life - threatening condition , is scarcely observed in subjects with macro tumors secreting prolactin ( prl ) and in other pituitary tumors ( pt ) . however , in some very rare cases it can be a primary presentation or appear after radiotherapy or medical treatment used for tumors destroying the sellar floor and/or the skull base . this destruction leads to cerebral spinal fluid ( csf ) leak , which can act as an entry portal for organisms predisposing to meningitis . our aim was to analyze sm frequency among male mprl deemed to be very invasive tumors , to report our cases and analyze the circumstances under which the dangerous neurological complication appeared . in this retrospective study , we analyzed 82 subjects with mprl to look for symptoms , clinical signs and biological proof of sm . , we took into account medical history , clinical examination , routine exploration , csf analysis and hormonal assessment . that one was based on prl , growth hormone ( gh ) , insulin growth hormone ( igf1 ) , cortisol , adrenocorticotropic hormone , testosterone , follicle stimulating hormone , luteinizing hormone , thyroid stimulating hormone and free thyroxin . radiological assessment was based on cerebral computed tomography scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) . three were first hospitalized in the department of infectious diseases for typical symptoms and signs of sm ; that one was proved by csf biochemical analyses . the fourth one was hospitalized in our department for the fourth episode of sm which was proved by csf analysis after lumbar puncture . cerebral mri showed a pt invading cavernous sinuses , the sphenoid sinus and the brain [ figure 1 ] . hormonal assessment [ table 1 ] demonstrated high prl with gonadotroph deficit . then , the pt was treated with dopamine agonists that were successful on prl ( 25 ng / ml ) and on tumor size [ figure 1 ] . after a follow - up of 7 years , invasive and aggressive pituitary tumor destroying the sella floor , responsible for suppurative meningitis ( sm ) in a 22-year - old man .

operative period or after tumor reduction by radiotherapy , apoplexy or medicine intake . the situation is observed in people in whom meninges and sella floor are destroyed by an aggressive pt or an ectopic one arising from the skull base . our 4 cases can be explained by the fact that prolactinomas are the largest and the most invasive pt , especially in males . male prolactinomas often destroy the sellar floor and invade the sphenoid sinus , then the nasopharynx . the meningeal and bony breaches lead to intra and extradural spaces communication , which is responsible for bacterial infection of meninges and encephalic structures . the most difficult differential diagnosis with meningitis occurring in people with pt is pituitary apoplexy , which mimics perfectly bacterial meningitis symptoms . however , a real microbial meningitis with or without rhinorrhea can be observed in apoplexy . the true microbial meningitis secondary to pt is an exceptional phenomenon compared to pituitary apoplexy , which is relatively more frequent . to our best knowledge only 15 sm , revealing pituitary adenomas or appearing under medical treatment have been reported so far . csf leak may proceed or not sm , and can be totally unnoticed . according to lam et al . who analyzed 29 articles published between 1980 and 2011 there were only 52 pt with csf leak . the seven cases were divided in two groups : the primitive meningitis or meningitis occurring prior to any treatment of the pt , and secondary meningitis occurring after surgery and/or dopamine agonists intake as in our 4 observation . our personal research found 15 cases meningitis secondary to pt . if we add our 4 cases , one can totalize 19 cases . in this group most pt were prolactinomas , especially males ones . among this group 14 were primitive . secondary ones ( n = 5 ) appeared under medical treatment , preceded or not by surgery or radiotherapy . sellar floor destruction was obvious on radiographies in all except one case [ table 2 ] . their age ( varying between 22 and 69 years ) did not seem to be a determining factor , but the nature of the adenoma and sphenoid sinus invasion seem fundamental . according to ciatto and to lascelles et al . we find only one case concerning gh adenoma treated by somatostatin 's analogs . a case of recurrent meningitis which appeared many years after neurosurgery was observed in nelson syndrome too . curiously sm was not reported in mixed pt and gonadotroph adenomas which are usually very large and very invasive . contrary to many authors and in agreement with ciatto , we think the association of pituitary adenoma and meningitis is more common than it is generally supposed as we observed it in nearly 5% of our male mprl . so , one should think about it more often even if a cause of sm seems obvious from the first sight as in our 4 case who suffered from chronic otitis . radiological research for pt should be systematic , especially if headaches , visual troubles , and gonadal abnormalities with or without anterior or posterior pituitary deficiencies are present . physicians who deal with large pt should be aware of high risk spontaneous meningitis , but also of secondary sm which can appear 1 month to 4 years or even more after medical treatment initiation by dopamine agonists or somatostatin 's analogs or radiotherapy . on another hand , medical treatment initiation should be gradual , especially for huge tumors as rapid shrinkage may lead to csf leak apparition . if this situation appears , a medical solution may be tried using temporary lumbar puncture or a lumboperitoneal shunt until the bony defect is clogged by fibrosis . if this attitude fails , surgical repair is recommended although the reparation may represent a great challenge because of the many potential sites of the csf around the tumor . if surgical repair in not feasible some authors recommend a vaccination against pathogens of the upper respiratory tract such as streptococcus pneumonia , haemophilus influenza and neisseria meningitidis to prevent sm . three revealed the pt , and one was observed after medical treatment . in 2 cases the described cases emphasize the necessity of an early diagnosis and treatment of large and invasive pt , especially male mprl . medical treatment , which is now the gold standard for prolactinomas , should be gradual and well monitored to avoid rhinorrhea or otorrhea which can lead to potentially fatal bacterial meningitis .", "output": "**Objective:**\nThe main research question or objective of the study is to analyze the frequency of suppurative meningitis (SM) among male macroprolactinomas (mprl) and to report cases where SM appeared as a primary presentation or after medical treatment.\n\n**Background:**\nSuppurative meningitis is a life-threatening condition that is rarely observed in subjects with macroprolactinomas or other pituitary tumors. However, in rare cases, it can be a primary presentation or appear after radiotherapy or medical treatment used for tumors destroying the sellar floor and/or the skull base.\n\n**Methods:**\nThis is a retrospective study that analyzed 82 subjects with mprl to look for symptoms, clinical signs, and biological proof of SM. The study included medical history, clinical examination, routine exploration, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and hormonal assessment. Radiological assessment was based on cerebral computed tomography scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\n**Key Findings:**\nThe study found 4 cases of SM among male mprl, which is a rare condition. The cases were characterized by the presence of a large and invasive pituitary tumor that destroyed the sellar floor and invaded the sphenoid sinus, leading to CSF leak and bacterial infection of the meninges. The study also found that SM can occur after medical treatment initiation by dopamine agonists or somatostatin's analogs or radiotherapy.\n\n**Conclusions:**\nThe study concludes that SM is a rare but potentially fatal complication of large and invasive pituitary tumors, especially male mprl. The study emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of large and invasive pituitary tumors to prevent SM. Medical treatment should be gradual and well-monitored to avoid rhinorrhea or otorrhea, which can lead to SM.\n\n**Clinical Relevance:**\nThe study's findings have significant clinical implications for the management of large and invasive pituitary tumors. Physicians should be aware of the risk of SM in patients with these tumors and should consider the possibility of SM in patients with symptoms of meningitis, even if a cause seems obvious. Radiological research for pituitary tumors should be systematic, especially if headaches, visual troubles, and gonadal abnormalities are present. Medical treatment initiation should be gradual, and patients should be monitored for signs of CSF leak and SM. If SM occurs, medical treatment may be tried using temporary lumbar puncture or a lumboperitoneal shunt, and surgical repair may be recommended if this fails.", "topic": "Meningitis", "cat": []}
{"input": "many studies have not been reported in literature for lumbar discectomy by destandau endospine system . we report a series of 300 patients operated for lumbar dissectomy by destandau endospine system . a total of 300 patients suffering from lumbar disc herniations were operated between january 2002 and december 2008 . technique comprised localization of symptomatic level followed by insertion of an endospine system devise through a 15 mm skin and fascial incision . endoscopic discectomy is then carried out by conventional micro disc surgery instruments by minimal invasive route . the results were evaluated by macnab 's criteria after a minimum followup of 12 months and maximum up to 24 months . based on modified macnab 's criteria , 90% patients had excellent to good , 8% had fair , and 2% had poor results . the complications observed were discitis and dural tear in five patients each and nerve root injury in two patients . 90% patients were able to return to light and sedentary work with an average delay of 3 weeks and normal physical activities after 2 months . the advantages of use of minimal invasive spinal surgical techniques in treatment of lumbar disc herniation is small incision , limited tissue disruption , enhanced visualization due to better magnification and illumination , shorter hospital stay , and faster recovery time.13 among many posterior spinal endoscopic systems used for disc surgery , destandau endospine system and foley and smith 's metrx system are seen as viable alternatives to open disc surgery.46 the aim of this study was to present results in 300 patients operated by edoscopic discectomy and to discuss technical points to shorten the learning curve . a total of 475 patients suffering from different type and level of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy and degenerative lumbar canal stenosis were operated between january 2002 and december 2008 . the inclusion criteria were patients having lumbar disc prolapse with unilateral radiculopathy , on clinical evaluation , positive straight leg raise or femoral stretch test , and identification of a single nerve root lesion on mri . patients with bilateral symptoms , double root involvement , cauda equina syndrome and whose clinical symptoms did not match mri picture were excluded from present study . all these patients had fair trial of conservative treatment in the form of rest , medication ( nsaid ) , activity modification , and physiotherapy ( minimum 6 weeks ) before they were advised to undergo surgery . however , in present study , none of the patients opted for surgery at 6 weeks after completion of conservative treatment . there were 206 males and 94 females aged between 18 to 72 years ( mean , 38.4 years ) . levels operated upon included l1-l2 ( n=3 ) , l2-l3 ( n=2 ) , l3-l4 ( n=6 ) , l4-l5 ( n=205 ) , and l5-s1 ( n=84 ) . there were 235 extruded , 20 contained , 15 foraminal , and 30 sequestrated herniations . results were evaluated as poor , fair , and good or excellent using modified macnab 's criteria . modified macnab 's grading was as follows : excellent - no pain / restriction of activity and being able to do all activities ; good - occasional pain with relief of presenting symptoms and returning to work with some modification ; fair - some improved functional capacity but still handicapped or unemployed ; and poor results - having objective symptoms of root involvement or repeat surgery at the index level . the clinical material included preoperative history , physical examination , plain x - rays and mri studies of lumbosacral spine , laboratory tests , and intraoperative video documentation . postoperative follow - up was carried out on third day , 2 weeks , 6 weeks , 3 , 6 , 12 , and 24 months . it consists of endospine tube , trocar , and working insert [ figure 1a and b ] . one port for 0 degree endoscope , second for suction cannula , third port ( biggest ) for working instrument , and fourth port for dural and nerve root retractor . the procedure of discectomy can be carried out under general , spinal , epidural , or local anesthesia . the operative technique consists of knee chest positioning after administration of anesthesia followed by level localization by localization devise [ figure 1c ] . at marked point , 15 mm skin incision is made aponeurosis is incised using mayo 's scissors ; 1.5 cm wide periosteal elevator is used to elevate paravertebral muscles subperiostealy , thus exposing the interlaminar window and part of the affected side facet .

up , 90% patients were relieved of sciatica and were satisfied with procedure . 285 patients were operated as day care cases and were mobilized and discharged same evening from day care facility . based on modified macnab 's criteria 90% patients had excellent to good , 8% had fair , and 2% had poor results . five patients who had interaoperative minor dural tears were hospitalized and were observed for any dural leak . causative factor for dural tears in present study were as follows : three patients had dural rent due to forceful retraction of dura and nerve root by dural and nerve root retractor . this was observed in patients in whom there was significant posterolateral herniation resulting in tenting of dura and nerve root at recess . in this situation , authors have found gentle mobilization of nerve root and dura by nerve root hook or approaching and debulking the offending disc through axilla before proceeding with retraction of nerve root and discectomy . this happened when kerrison rongeur was used to open the tight recess resulting in dural tear and nerve root injury . these dural tears were managed by water tight closure of muscle , fascia , and skin and bed rest for duration of one week . superficial delayed wound healing was observed in 20 patients , which healed in 21 days by regular dressings rest and administration of antibiotics . the diagnosis of postsurgical discitis was based on mainly clinical grounds and laboratory evidence of raised counts , esr , and c - reactive proteins . clinical criteria included recurrence of severe and unrelenting back pain within first week of surgery , keeping patient awake at night after initial recovery . no biopsy of disc was resorted to ; however , mri of lumbosacral spine was ordered in all these patients which did not contribute much to the diagnosis . lizolid 600 mg / bd ) for first week followed by oral antibiotics for 5 weeks . all these patients responded well to antibiotics and no further intervention of any kind was carried out . after initial back pain for 6 weeks , these patients had occasional residual backache which was treated by analgesics , activity modification , lumbar support , and rest during subsequent follow - up visits . nerve root injuries ( n=2 ) were encountered while trying to do a medial facetectomy to open the recess by a kerrison rongeur causing severe laceration of nerve root . however , nerve root was in continuity . , patties were used for gentle retraction and procedure of discectomy was successfully completed endoscopically without resorting to open discectomy . 276 patients were able to return to sedentary work with an average delay of 2 weeks , except 24 patients who had complains of backache , occasional leg discomfort , discitis , and nerve root injuries . medial facetectomy was resorted to in 59 patients to open the recess to decompress the nerve root in addition to discectomy . mixter and barr7 discovered the pathophysiology of discogenic sciatica and suggested laminectomy and discectomy as operative treatment . the overall results of standard discectomy range from 68 to 95% in different series.8 the operative microscope and microsurgical techniques were developed in mid-1960 's by yasargil and krayenbuhl910 and these techniques revolutionized spine surgery leading to smaller incisions , less blood loss , increased visualization of site of pathology , decreased hospitalization , shorter postoperative recovery , and earlier return to activities compared with previous operative interventional techniques . the results of microdiscectomy also range from 85 to 98%.1113 katayama et al.14 compared the results of open vs gold standard microdiscectomy and observed no difference between the surgical outcomes in both the groups but microdiscectomy gave better lighting , magnification , and therefore decreased the length of incision and tissue invasion . microdiscectomy also allowed the patients to return to early work with lesser use of narcotic medication . microendoscopic dissectomy ( med ) combines standard microsurgical technique with an endoscope , enabling the surgeons to address all types of disc herniations including decompression of nerve root and lateral recess . chemonucleolysis was reported by smith.15 nonetheless , based upon various randomized clinical trials , the efficacy of chemonucleolysis compared with more traditional and open procedures for the operative treatment of lumbar disc herniations remained speculative.16 the use of percutaneous nucleotomy , laser discectomy , and intradiscal electrothermal annuloplasty ( idet ) compared with microdiscectomy remains unclear , and it is attributed to the lack of high - quality studies.17 conclusions about the efficacy of some of the aforementioned minimally invasive procedures ( e.g. , chemonucleolysis , apd , idet ) were questionable with regard to disc - related pathology.18 therefore , lumbar microdiscectomy remained the gold standard for addressing a herniated or sequestrated intervertebral disc ; however , a movement toward more minimally invasive approaches that would yield superior outcomes , while minimizing excessive soft and bony tissue removal and minimizing soft tissue trauma , were sought . as such , an evolution in procedures toward smaller incisions , less tissue trauma , and quicker return to daily activities took center stage in spine surgery . the use of muscular retractor system was reported initially by faubert and caspar.1920 perez - curet and fessler,21 described for the first time a myriad of spine pathologies that could be addressed using tubeology . though from our initial experience , endospine technique is minimal invasive , but limitation of study has been lack of comparison with gold standard microscopic discectomy technique . however , in a study by shin et al.,22 15 cases each were compared of med and microscopic group ( md ) . the mean cpk - mm levels were lower for the med group than for the md group at both 3 ( 576.1286.3 iu / l compared with 968.1377.8 iu / l ) and 5 days ( 348.1231.0 iu / l compared with 721.7463.2 ) postoperatively ( p<0.05 ) . the mean vas scores for postoperative back pain were lower in the med group than in the md group , both at 1 ( 3.32.3 compared with 5.81.5 ) and 5 days ( 1.91.1 compared with 3.61.1 ) postoperatively ( p<0.01 ) . aforementioned authors concluded that the med procedure is less invasive than md , and causes less muscle damage and backache . the 90% excellent results in present study is comparable with other surgical procedures for herniated lumbar discs such as those of destandau , perez - cruet et al . , and their average surgical time was 66 minutes , average blood loss was 22 ml , average hospital stay was 7.7 hours , complication rate was 5% , reoperation rate was 4% , and average return to work was 17 days with excellent result in 94% patients . average operative time was 50 minutes average blood loss was 45 ml ( range , 30 - 70 ml ) . return to work ( 21 days ) and overall results ( 90% ) which are comparable . in another prospective and randomized evaluation of surgical treatment for lumbar disc herniation by hermantin et al.,24 satisfactory results of 97% in endoscopic group ( n=30 ) and 93% in open laminectomy group ( n=30 ) were reported . however , in endoscopic group , these authors had excluded large central herniations and extra ligamentous herniations between l5 and first sacral vertebra . however , present endoscopic technique could be used for all levels and all type of herniations . in our current series , there was 5% discitis and 5% incidence of dural injury . caspar and ebling,2526 authors have reported reoperation rate of 5.5 , 5.7 , and 3% , respectively . another measure of success is reflected by the patient 's ability to return to previous employment . our patients returned to previous employment on an average at 15 days with restriction to avoid heavy manual work for 2 months . discectomy ( med ) by endospine system has claimed even lesser tissue invasion than microdiscectomy with even smaller skin incision , lesser use of analgesics , and early return to work . least tissue invasion is established by many reports comparing the postoperative mri signal of paraspinal muscles,27 intraoperative electromyographic findings establishing less invasion to nerve roots,28 and by measuring serum levels of biochemical parameters reflective of a postoperative inflammatory reaction and damage to the paravertebral muscles.29 our personal opinion is similar , though this was not the parameter studied in our series . minimal invasive microendoscopic decompression technique has been used not only for paracentral disc herniations , but also for all types including far lateral , cephalad , caudal migrated , and central and recurrent disc herniations.3032 one of the driving forces behind the minimal invasive spine surgery is economics , shorter hospital stay , reduced postoperative morbidity , and quicker recovery times . in our series , 90% patients were operated as day care cases . posterior paraspinous process endoscopic access to lumbar disc herniation requires creation of working space where no or little space existed before . internal view of operating site is magnified and well illuminated . with advent of this system , discectomy can be done as day care procedure ensuring reduced postoperative morbidity , minimal or no hospitalization , less pain , and faster recovery . with proper patient selection , discectomy and adequate nerve root decompression by doing foraminotomy or opening a lateral recess stenosis by minimally invasive technique can be achieved with this system . however , the endospine system has been excellent modality to address discogenic radiculopathy and to decompress lumbar canal stenosis . many surgeons are convinced of advantages of the system and have included this system as part of their inventry . however , due to difficulty in orientation with scope and two - dimensional vision , availability of less space , frustrating and steep learning curve , and inability to master hand eye coordination , majority of surgeons are not able to continue with the technique . the patience and persvrance to work through narrow confines and work closely with a surgeon who has mastered the technique is the key to learn . second step would be to become comfortable with 2 dimensional vision of endoscopic camera and to master orientation , triangulation . depth perception in these techniques comes from experience rather than observation ; hence , surgeon keen to learn these techniques must combine these procedures during early phase of learning with standard procedures he is doing in his clinical practice . gradually , as surgeons master the learning curve , he will be able to use this as treatment method for his patients . there is also a need to establish cadaveric labs and dummy models on line of arthroscopic learning centers where surgeons can practice hands - on cadavers and models to improve triangulation , depth perception , and hand eye coordination .", "output": "**1.

Objective:**\nThe main research question or objective of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of switching from insulin to oral sulfonylurea therapy in a patient with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) caused by a novel mutation in the KCNJ11 gene.\n\n**2. Background:**\nThe study is based on the fact that PNDM is a monogenic form of diabetes that presents within the first 6 months of life, and that activating mutations in the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes encoding the subunits Kir6.2 and SUR1 of the ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel in pancreatic beta cells are the most common causes of PNDM. The study aims to explore the possibility of replacing insulin therapy with oral sulfonylurea in patients with PNDM.\n\n**3. Methods:**\nThe study involved a single case report of a patient with PNDM caused by a novel mutation in the KCNJ11 gene. The patient was initially treated with insulin therapy, but was later switched to oral sulfonylurea therapy at the age of 4.8 years. The patient's response to sulfonylurea therapy was monitored through regular laboratory tests, including glucose tolerance tests and measurements of insulin and C-peptide levels.\n\n**4. Key Findings:**\nThe study found that the patient's insulin secretion improved significantly after switching to sulfonylurea therapy, as evidenced by increased insulinogenic index and acute C-peptide response. The patient's glycemic control also improved, with a reduction in HbA1c levels. The study also found that the patient experienced no episodes of hypoglycemia after switching to sulfonylurea therapy.\n\n**5. Conclusions:**\nThe study concludes that switching from insulin to oral sulfonylurea therapy can be an effective treatment option for patients with PNDM caused by activating mutations in the KCNJ11 gene. The study also highlights the importance of early genetic analysis and trial of sulfonylurea therapy in the management of neonatal diabetes.\n\n**6. Clinical Relevance:**\nThe study's findings have significant clinical relevance, as they suggest that oral sulfonylurea therapy can be a safe and effective alternative to insulin therapy for patients with PNDM. The study also highlights the potential benefits of early genetic analysis and trial of sulfonylurea therapy in improving glycemic control and reducing the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with neonatal diabetes.\n\n**7. Future Directions:**\nThe study suggests that further studies are needed to investigate the long-term effects of sulfonylurea therapy in patients with PNDM and to explore the potential benefits of early genetic analysis and trial of sulfonylurea therapy in improving glycemic control and reducing the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with neonatal diabetes.", "topic": "Neonatal diabetes mellitus", "cat": []}

Methods:**\nThe study involved 20 patients who underwent diagnostic and therapeutic contrast-enhanced examinations. The patients' demographic characteristics, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, and creatinine clearance were analyzed before and after radiocontrast administration. Spot urine IL-18 levels were measured before and 6 and 24 hours after radiocontrast administration.

Clinical Relevance:**\nThe study's findings have implications for the early detection and prevention of RIN. Identifying an early biomarker for RIN can help clinicians to take preventive measures, such as adjusting the contrast agent dose or using alternative contrast agents, to reduce the risk of RIN.

It can lead to urinary retention, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and irreversible damage to the kidney. The abnormality can be suspected in the fetus by antenatal ultrasonography (USG) and confirmed by other X-ray investigations after birth.\n\n**Methods:** The study used a case report design, where a 5-year-old female child was referred to the department for a Tc-DTPA scan. The child had a history of right-sided hydroureteronephrosis with pyonephrosis and had undergone percutaneous tube (PCN) insertion on the right side. The child's blood urea and serum creatinine levels were 29 and 1.3 mg/dl, respectively. USG of the abdomen revealed left-sided mild hydroureteronephrosis and gross enlargement of the right kidney. A Tc-DTPA scan was performed with the right PCN tube in situ, and the images were analyzed to evaluate the renal function and excretory function of the kidneys.\n\n**Key Findings:** The Tc-DTPA scan showed good perfusion and adequate cortical radiotracer concentration in the left kidney, followed by good drainage into the dilated ureter. However, the right ureter and right pelvicalyceal system (PCS) were visualized in the postvoid image, indicating indirect evidence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Retention of radiotracer was noted in the dilated PCS and dilated ureter in delayed static images acquired till 4 hours. A large photopenia was noted in the suprapubic region in the urinary bladder (UB) during dynamic and delayed static images. USG of the abdomen revealed evidence of left-sided mild hydroureteronephrosis and grossly enlarged hydronephrotic right kidney with dilated right ureter and an intracystic ureterocele arising from the right side.\n\n**Conclusions:** The study concludes that Tc-DTPA scan is useful in the evaluation of renal function in patients with known ureteroceles. However, in this case, the diagnosis of ureterocele was missed on initial USG, and the photopenia in the UB on Tc-DTPA scan prompted further investigation, which revealed an intravesical ureterocele on USG.\n\n**Clinical Relevance:** The study highlights the importance of thorough evaluation of the urinary system in patients with suspected ureterocele, especially in cases where UTIs are present. The study also emphasizes the role of Tc-DTPA scan in evaluating renal function in patients with known ureteroceles. The diagnosis of ureterocele can be challenging, and a combination of imaging modalities, including USG, VCUG, and Tc-DTPA scan, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.", "topic": "Ureterocele", "cat": []}

this dose was maintained for 7 days ) . therefore , she underwent a repeated short - term follow - up egd that showed regenerative epithelial tissue with peeling off , of the necrotic tissue ( fig . she underwent a repeated egd that showed the replacement of white color scar tissue ( fig . currently , she is being treated with 30 mg / day prednisone and is showing considerable clinical improvement . eosinophilic gastroenteritis is an uncommon and rarely reported disorder characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the various tissue layers of the digestive tract in the absence of any definite causes of eosinophilia , without eosinophilic infiltration in other organs . the diagnosis of eosinophilic gastroenteritis is based on the following criteria : the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms , histological presentation of eosinophilic infiltration in tissue layers of the digestive tract , presence of high eosinophil count in ascites , and no evidence of parasitic infection or eosinophilic involvement of extraintestinal organs . eosinophilic gastroenteritis can involve any portion of the gastrointestinal tract from the esophagus to the rectum , and the stomach is the most commonly involved organ , especially the antrum . in eosinophilic gastritis , the endoscopic features are rather extensive : rugal fold thickening , erythema , friability , nodularity , gastric outlet obstruction , gastric ulcer , and even a normal mucosa . although not clearly defined , the common pathophysiological mechanism of this disease is associated with eosinophilic infiltration and degranulation in specific tissue layers of the digestive tract . this eosinophilic recruitment and activation regulated by diverse cytokines is a part of the host immune mechanism in the gastrointestinal mucosa ; however , it can be a type of serious allergic or inflammatory reaction in the deeper tissue layers of the gastrointestinal tract . although there is no treatment consensus on eosinophilic gastroenteritis , several studies report good results with steroids in dosages from 20 to 40 mg / day , for 6 to 8 weeks [ 7 - 10 ] . in some case studies , leukotriene modifiers such as montelukast or mast cell stabilizers such as sodium cromoglycate have been proposed to be helpful for symptomatic improvement . antihistamines such as ketotifen or immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil are also used in the treatment of eosinophilic gastroenteritis ; however , their therapeutic effects are not clear and would require more studies . although rare , eosinophilic gastritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and peripheral blood eosinophilia . lymphoma of the stomach , gastric cancer , and crohn disease involving the stomach may demonstrate endoscopic features similar to those of eosinophilic gastritis . gastrointestinal parasitic infection should be considered in patients with abdominal discomfort , weight loss , and peripheral eosinophilia . in particular , infestations by hookworms , ascaris , strongyloides , toxocara , trichuris , and intestinal capillaria should be considered in patients from endemic areas . in this case , the concentration of the antigen - specific ige to the a. simplex was 0.57 moreover , the serology for toxocara antibodies ( igg ) was positive . however , this is not clinically significant in korea because koreans often consume raw fish , which causes repeated exposures to anisakis . in addition , she had not had contact with any animals , including dogs and cats , at least for several years . moreover , she was treated with albendazole for 5 days , and her symptoms had become worse . after steroid treatment , the symptoms disappeared and the eosinophil count decreased to the reference range . moreover , the follow - up egd showed regenerative epithelial tissue with peeling off , of the necrotic tissue . she had undergone several egds that showed diffuse necrotic change in the fundus , cardia , and upper body . the etiology includes thromboembolism and occlusion of major arterial supply , ingestion of corrosive agents , volvulus of the stomach , endoscopic hemostatic injections , and infectious gastritis . in this case thus , the possible cause of gangrene could be infection , and she was treated with empirical intravenous antibiotics ( cefoperazone and metronidazole ) . however , she was treated with broad - spectrum antibiotics during the next 5 days , and her symptoms became worse . the necrotic portion of the gastric high body is very vulnerable site of retching injury . this retching injury is called prolapse gastropathy syndrome , a clinical syndrome involving the invagination of part of the gastric mucosa into the lower esophagus . direct trauma to the mucosa occurs when the gastric mucosa becomes incarcerated through the lower esophageal sphincter . in addition , the endoscopic findings and histopathologic results were not compatible to prolapse gastropathy syndrome . on the basis of the clinical picture , laboratory findings , and therapeutic results , we concluded the diagnosis of eosinophilic gastritis presenting as necrotizing gastritis in our patient . this case highlights the reality of eosinophilic gastritis presenting as necrotizing gastritis , and that endoscopy and histopathological examination of the biopsies are the most useful tools for the diagnosis of eosinophilic gastritis presenting as necrotizing gastritis . eosinophilic gastritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with necrotic gastritis who do not respond to empirical treatment .", "output": " The study aims to present a case of a rare disease called eosinophilic gastritis, characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract without any definite causes of eosinophilia. The patient, a 52-year-old female, presented with epigastric pain and tenderness, along with symptoms such as abdominal pain, emesis, abdominal distension, and weight loss. The disease was diagnosed based on clinical pictures, laboratory findings, and endoscopic findings, and was treated with methylprednisolone.\n\nThe study was conducted on this single patient, and the methods used included esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), abdominal computed tomography, serological tests for various viral markers, autoimmune antibodies, tumor markers, and toxocara antibodies. The key finding was the positive serology for toxocara antibodies, while other tests were normal.\n\nThe authors conclude that eosinophilic gastritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and peripheral blood eosinophilia. They emphasize that endoscopy and histopathological examination of biopsies are the most useful tools for diagnosing eosinophilic gastritis.\n\nClinically, the study's findings could impact medical practice by raising awareness of eosinophilic gastritis, a rare but significant condition that may be misdiagnosed as other diseases. Early and accurate diagnosis could lead to appropriate treatment, potentially improving patient outcomes. However, more research is needed to establish a consensus on the treatment of eosinophilic gastroenteritis.", "topic": "Eosinophilic gastritis", "cat": []}

{"input": "adolescents in sub - saharan africa face high exposure to human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) infection . despite all efforts to prevent the disease , prevalence estimates in sub - saharan unaids ( i.e. , the joint united nations programme on hiv and aids ) priority countries range from 1.3 to 15.6  % among young women and 0.56.5  % among young men aged 1524  years ( unaids , 2011 ) . higher prevalence estimates are associated with certain regions ( e.g. , eastern and southern africa ) and subpopulations ( e.g. , adolescent orphaned and/or married girls ; birdthistle et al . , 2008 ; operario , underhill , chuong , & cluver , 2011 ; pascoe et al . , 2010 ) . in addition , united nations children s fund ( unicef ) estimated there were 2  million adolescents aged 1019  years living with hiv globally in 2009 ( unicef , 2011 ) . kenya and zimbabwe were among countries with the highest numbers of infected adolescents with an estimated 136,000 ( prevalence estimate 1.5  % ) 1 and 104,000 ( prevalence estimate 3.1  % ) adolescents living with hiv , respectively ( unicef , 2011 ) . the true measure of effectiveness for such interventions is reduction in hiv and other sexually transmitted infections ( stis ) . however , very few adolescent prevention studies have used biomarker data as outcomes ( michielsen et al . , 2010 ) because of concerns about the difficulties in collecting these data in resource poor settings ( jukes , simmons , & bundy , 2008 ) , even when power analyses suggest that moderate intervention effects could be detected . behavioral prevention scientists have instead relied on self - reported sexual behavior , which is subject to social desirability bias and likely to differ between study arms ( cowan & pettifor , 2009 ; kirby , obasi , & laris , 2006 ) . widespread access to testing and treatment facilitated by the president s emergency plan for aids relief ( pepfar ; http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/global-health/hiv-and-aids ) have greatly enhanced opportunities to successfully incorporate biomarker procedures into adolescent hiv prevention research designs , since infected individuals identified through testing offered by studies may access free or subsidized hiv treatment and care ( stringer et al . , 2006 ; wools - kaloustian et al . , 2006 , 2009 ) moreover , including biomarker outcomes can greatly improve the credibility and legitimacy of hiv prevention research . to address the issue of feasibility , we present two case studies of prevention trials with biomarker data collection among adolescents in kenya and zimbabwe . together these studies provide a valuable opportunity to examine the ethical and practical challenges of biomarker procedures within hiv prevention intervention clinical trials in developing countries . specifically , we describe the challenges faced by investigators in the two cases in developing and implementing ethical procedures for informed consent , biomarker testing , and disclosure of test results . we also present the practical challenges of collecting biological samples in resource - limited countries and compare sample collection by blood spots relative to venipuncture . in addition , we examine difficulties with analyzing biological samples when the performance of assays in certain populations is unclear . we also provide specific suggestions for further research and development in collecting and analyzing biomarker data for adolescent prevention research . the primary goal of hiv prevention among adolescents ( ages 1019  years ) is to reduce new infections and related sexual risk factors [ world health organization ( who ) , 2006 ) . although the hiv prevalence of adolescents ages 15 and older is monitored through demographic and health surveys ( dhs)2 in most sub - saharan africa countries , little is known about the prevalence of hiv in adolescents under 15  years . moreover , these adolescents are rarely tested for hiv in clinical settings unless they present in poor health or with recurrent infections ( ferrand et al . , 2009 ) . although a small number of recent randomized controlled trials have used biomarkers ( baird , mcintosh , & ozler , 2010 ; cowan et al . ; pronyk et al . , 2006 ; ross et al . , 2007 ) , most adolescent hiv prevention studies have relied on changes in self - reported sexual behavior to assess intervention effectiveness ( see reviews : cowan & pettifor , 2009 ; michielsen et al . , 2010 ) , with audio computer - assisted self - interviews intended to improve veracity ( mensch , erulkar , & hewett , 2003 ) . however , biomarker comparisons have suggested that self - reported measures have low validity ( cowan et al . , 2002 ; gavin et al . , 2006 ; mensch , hewett , gregory , & helleringer , 2008 ; palen et al . , 2008 ; plummer et al . , 2004 ) . for example , in one study , only one of 16 youth with hiv admitted to ever having sex , and four of the 16 also had either chlamydia or gonorrhea ( cowan et al . , 2002 ) . inclusion of a highly prevalent and reliable biomarker of sexual activity in conjunction with self - reported sexual behavior can help to improve reliability of this outcome measure . hiv infection is not the most useful biomarker of adolescent sexual activity by itself because of the relatively low prevalence among younger adolescents and the potential for transmission through perinatal and non - sexual blood - borne routes ( amornkul et al . , 2009 ; ferrand et al . , 2009 ; stover , walker , grassly , & marston , 2006 ) . herpes simplex virus type 2 ( hsv-2 ) , the primary cause of genital herpes , is a commonly used biomarker of sexual activity because the presence of hsv-2 antibodies is highly associated with past sexual behavior ( tobian et al . , 2009 ; van de laar et al . , 1998 ) . in contrast to other stis such as chlamydia , gonorrhea , syphilis and trichomoniasis , infection with hsv-2 is life - long , and , once established , there is currently no treatment to eliminate it ( geretti , 2006 ; gupta , warren , & wald , 2008 ) . hsv-2 prevalence in the adult general population in sub - saharan africa is high , ranging from 30 to 80  % in women and from 10 to 50  % in men , as assessed by detection of hsv-2 antibodies [ amornkul et al . , 2009 ; , 2005 ; munjoma et al . , 2010 ; national aids & sti control programme ( nascop ) , republic of kenya , 2009 ; tobian et al . , 2009 ; weiss , 2004 ] . prevalence estimates for adolescents are only available through community - based studies and are lower . one study in zimbabwe among adolescent females aged 1519  years reported that 12  % of participants tested positive for hsv-2 ( birdthistle et al . a study in western kenya found hsv-2 prevalence to be 9  % for females and 4  % for males aged 1314 , and 28  % for females and 17  % for males aged 1519  years ( amornkul et al . , 2009 ) . another study conducted in zimbabwe among adolescents whose mean age was 15  years reported a prevalence estimate of 0.2  % , suggesting a later stage of sexual debut ( cowan et al . 2012 ) evaluated the use of hsv-2 as a biomarker of sexual debut among young people aged 1024  years . following a comprehensive review of the literature , the authors concluded that the use of hsv-2 as a biomarker for sexual debut is limited because of its low transmissibility and the fact that not all potential sexual partners are infected with the virus . building on these findings , our study describes the challenges of collecting hiv and hsv-2 biological data as biomarkers for sexual activity among sub - saharan african youth in prevention trials . we present two clinical trial case studies to examine important issues related to adolescent biomarker data collection in two clinical trials in kenya and zimbabwe ( hallfors et al . , both studies were school - based , cluster randomized trials testing school support ( including payment of school tuition and school uniforms ) as a structural hiv prevention intervention for adolescent orphans . in both studies , we collected blood samples from participants for hiv and hsv-2 testing , but they differed as follows : we collected samples by venipuncture with results disclosed to participants and their guardians in kenya , whereas in zimbabwe , we collected samples by finger pricks for dried blood spots ( dbs ) and results were not disclosed . the kenya sample ( n  =  837 ) comprised young adolescent male ( 52  % ) and female ( 48  % ) orphans in grades 7 ( 61  % ) and 8 ( 39  % ) enrolled in school in siaya district , nyanza province . their mean age was 14.9 ( sd 1.5 ; range 1121  years ) ; 22  % reported ever having had sex . among girls , hiv and hsv-2 prevalence was 1  % ( n  =  10 ) and 3  % ( n  =  28 ) , respectively . among those with positive hiv or hsv-2 test results , 70  % ( n  =  7 ) and 64  % ( n  =  18 ) , respectively , reported never having had sex . the original sample for the zimbabwe study was orphan 6th grade girls ( n  =  328 ) in manicaland province primary schools ; surveys were administered annually during 20072010 ( hallfors et al . , 2011 ) . after securing a project renewal grant , we collected biomarker specimens and a final survey in march through june 2012 , when most participants were 1617  years old . from the original sample , we located 287 ( 88  % ) for the 2012 survey . twenty - three percent reported ever having sex ; 18  % had ever been married and/or pregnant . hiv and hsv-2 prevalence was 4  % ( n  =  12 ) and 6  % ( n  =  16 ) , respectively . among those with positive hiv or hsv-2 test results , 50  % ( n  =  6 ) and 44  % ( n  =  7 ) , respectively , reported never having had sex . although the protection of adult participants in hiv prevention research is well developed ( national institute of mental health collaborative hiv / std prevention trial group , 2007 ) , we found that clear guidance regarding hiv and other sti testing and disclosure is lacking for children and adolescents . as an example , our two clinical trials were peer - reviewed by two different nih scientific review panels ; one set of reviewers thought that it was an ethical imperative to disclose hsv-2 as well as hiv results to adolescents , whereas the other was concerned that disclosure of biomarker results might lead to stigma and abuse . these divergent opinions led to discrepant protocols for disclosure , with one trial disclosing and the other not disclosing test results to participants . we used the national hiv testing and counseling ( htc ) guidelines [ central statistical office ( cso ) & macro international inc . , 2007 ; nascop , republic of kenya , 2008 ] for hiv in both countries . given the lack of national guidelines for adolescent sti testing in kenya [ ministry of health ( moh ) , republic of kenya , 2006 ) , we developed a protocol in conjunction with the siaya district aids and std control office that closely followed hiv guidelines . study protocols were reviewed and approved by irbs in the us , kenya and zimbabwe . the kenya study was approved by the ministry of education and siaya district education office ; school head teachers identified orphans and organized meetings in which moi university research collaborators and a district education officer explained the study to students and their caregivers . caregivers and students we invited a total of 923 orphans in grades 7 and 8 in 2011 to participate ; 849 ( 92  % ) consented and 837 ( 91  % ) completed both the student survey and biomarker testing . following national guidelines , we required kenya study participants under age 18 to have an adult guardian accompany them for hiv rapid testing ( nascop , republic of kenya , 2008 ) . in some instances , however , the guardian was not available because of work , other commitments , or illness . in such cases we permitted a relative , teacher or neighbor to stand - in for the guardian if they had a note from the guardian or if research staff were able to speak with the guardian by phone . given the sensitive nature of hiv testing , the senior counselor interviewed all unclear or undocumented cases to determine whether or not to proceed with specimen collection and htc . we visited clinics several times to give participants the opportunity to return for testing with their guardian or authorized proxy . although not required , all participants ages 18 and older were accompanied by an adult for support in case of a positive hiv test result . in accordance with national guidelines , we gave referrals to publicly funded hiv care and treatment centers to all adolescents with positive hiv test results , while hiv negative participants were counseled on risk reduction ( nascop , republic of kenya , 2008 ) . we disclosed results to both guardians and participants if the latter were under age 18 and to the participants alone if they were 18  years old according to the study protocol . in zimbabwe , with permission from the provincial education officer , the consortium principal investigator and a research associate held meetings at study schools to explain the continuing study to parents / guardians , participants , and key school staff . we obtained written parent / guardian consent and participant assent for continued voluntary participation in the study , including separate checkbox consent for survey and blood sample collection . guardians raised few concerns , although they did ask why we were not disclosing test results . participants who were married or 18  years or older provided their own consent . in deference to local cultural norms and to prevent potential spousal abuse , we prepared a second consent form for husbands to provide consent for their wives participation . most of the wives gave their own consent for the survey and did not ask their husbands for consent . in four cases , the husband signed a consent form and in five additional cases , the husband refused and the wife did not take the survey . although asking husbands for permission for their wives study participation is not consistent with us culture , it appears to be a useful protocol accommodation for some young wives in rural zimbabwe . we consistently relied on local researchers and key informants to make such culturally sensitive decisions . after 4  months , we found 88  % of the original sample who consented to the survey ; 85  % consented to blood specimen collection . of those not surveyed , two participants had died in childbirth , 2  % refused , and approximately 10  % of the sample could not be found . of those not consenting to blood specimen collection ( n  =  8) , six were married and refused for religious reasons or husband s objection . two were consented for the survey by school officials who refused to provide additional consent for the blood collection , and no guardian was available to give permission . hiv testing is technically far more advanced for widespread use in sub - saharan africa than hsv-2 testing . rapid hiv antibody tests are now widely used and accepted ( moh , republic of kenya , 2006 ) , and sequential algorithms for retesting have been adopted in kenya and zimbabwe for rapid testing ( cso & macro international inc . , 2007 ; nascop , republic of kenya , 2008 ; who , 2004 ) . rapid hiv tests meet high performance standards , sample collection procedures are simple , tests are easy to perform , and interpretation of test results is reasonably clear . in contrast , hsv-2 serologic testing presents some important challenges . although a number of hsv-2 type - specific serologic tests are available , only a limited number have been tested among sub - saharan african populations . these include the herpeselect hsv-2 enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ; focus diagnostics , cypress , ca ) and kalon hsv-2 elisa ( kalon biological ltd . , guildford , uk ; biraro , mayaud , morrow , grosskurth , & weiss , 2011 ) . these tests require skilled laboratory staff , specialized equipment , and a constant source of electricity . they are appropriate for use with large batches of samples as in sentinel surveys and are inexpensive , costing about $ 3 per test . although the literature reports variable performance of these tests with respect to sensitivity and specificity in sub - saharan populations , kalon is often found to be superior to focus herpeselect ( see biraro et al . , 2011 for a review of the performance of hsv-2 tests in sub - saharan africa ; 2008 ; ngayo , friedrich , holmes , bukusi , & morrow , 2010 ; smith et al . , 2009 ; van dyck et al . , 2004 ) . when using the manufacturer s instructions ( index cutoff value  =  1.1 for both tests ) , kalon tends to have lower sensitivity but higher specificity than focus herpeselect ( delany - moretlwe et al . , 2010 ; gamiel et al . , 2008 ; ngayo et al . , 2010 ; smith et al . , 2009 ; van dyck et al . , the low specificity of focus herpeselect is particularly problematic when disclosing results to research participants because of an unacceptably high rate of false positives when prevalence is low ( gamiel et al . , 2008 ; mark et al . , 2008 ; ngayo et al , 2010 ; van dyck et al . , 2004 ) . increasing the assay cut - off values is one strategy for improving the performance of both the kalon and focus herpeselect tests . a number of studies have shown that increasing the cut - off value for focus herpeselect to 3.5 increases specificity , although sensitivity is necessarily reduced ( delany - moretlwe et al . , 2010 ; smith et al . , other studies similarly improved performance at cut - off values of 3.2 and 3.3 ( delany - moretlwe et al . , 2010 ; gamiel et al . , 2008 ; ngayo et al . , although findings are mixed , increasing the cut - off value for the kalon test to 1.5 has also been shown to increase specificity , with an attendant reduction in sensitivity ( gamiel et al . , 2008 ; ngayo et al . in our studies , the kenya laboratory used the kalon assay , and the zimbabwe laboratory used the focus test . at the time of our studies , neither assay had been validated for dbs by the manufacturer in african populations . the efficiency of dbs for hsv-2 testing with each assay must be evaluated in specific populations prior to use ( hogrefe , ernst , & su , 2002 ) . because the kalon test had not been validated for hsv-2 testing with dbs samples , specimens in the kenya study were obtained by venipuncture . the zimbabwe laboratory had validated the focus test with dbs ( mudzori & mutsogoro , 2006 ) . in both studies , we used a modified algorithm to interpret results : samples with initial index values < 0.9 were reported as negative and no further testing was conducted . samples with initial index values > 2.5 were defined as high positive and were reported as positive without additional testing . samples with initial index values from 1.5 to 2.5 were considered low positive , and those with initial index values between 0.9 and 1.5 were considered equivocal ; all low positives and equivocals were retested in duplicate . if both retest results had index values > 1.5 , the final result was reported as positive . if both retest results were < 0.9 , the final result was negative . if retest results were equivocal ( 0.91.5 ) or discordant , the final result was indeterminate . although test performance was improved by increasing the cut - off and expanding the range of results for repeat testing , the performance characteristics of tests to detect antibodies to hsv-2 are imperfect . based on a recent systematic review of hsv-2 antibody test performance in sub - saharan africa ( biraro et al . , 2011 ) , sensitivity for the kalon test used in kenya was estimated at 94  % and specificity at 92  % with the higher cut - off value of 1.5 . the predictive values of all diagnostic tests are strongly influenced by the prevalence of infection in the population , and in low prevalence situations , even a very good test will have a poor positive predictive value ( ppv ) . using the sensitivity and specificity values for the kalon test under the testing conditions employed in our kenya study , the ppv was estimated at 26  % with a 3  % hsv-2 prevalence . that is , we can be confident that about one in four participants with positive test results truly had hsv-2 antibodies present in their blood sample ; however , as many as three in four could have had a false positive test result . in kenya , we conducted sample collection and htc primarily in local public health facilities near the schools . eighteen facilities participated . in two sites , with permission from the school headmasters and district education officer , we collected blood samples and conducted htc at the school . venipuncture was conducted by six skilled phlebotomists trained in htc . to avoid obtaining two separate blood specimens ( finger prick for rapid hiv testing and venipuncture for hsv-2 testing ) the process , including counseling , blood draw , hiv testing , disclosure of results took on average 20  min . the process was longer for participants with discordant results who needed a tie - breaker test and for participants with hiv positive results . we offered all participants and their guardians a snack either before or after specimen collection . we stored blood samples for hsv-2 testing in labeled vacutainer tubes in a cooler box without ice and transported them to a local laboratory within 24  h for serum processing . sera were stored at the local laboratory in a freezer at 20  c until transport on ice weekly to the hsv-2 testing laboratory . the logistics of specimen collection , processing and transport for this study were challenging but feasible . in comparison , we did not require guardians to be present because hiv results were not provided to participants . sampling and dbs preparation were much less obvious to others nearby , helping to safeguard participant privacy and reduce concerns about witchcraft or other conspiracy theories regarding hiv / aids and blood , which circulate in sub - saharan african communities ( tenkorang , gyimah , maticka - tyndale , & adjei , 2011 ) . blood from the finger prick was dropped on five circles on a dbs filter card labeled with the participant s study i d . some participants may have been dehydrated or not very well nourished , making it difficult to fill all circles , but adequate samples were collected from all participants . specimens were dried , stored with a desiccant , and transported to the testing lab at ambient temperatures . dbs samples are easy to store and transport and require no processing or refrigeration ( see table  1 for a summary of the study procedures).table  1comparison of biomarker testing procedures in two research studieskenyazimbabweethical considerationswritten guardian consent if < 18/adolescent assentwritten guardian consent / adolescent assentresults disclosed to guardian and adolescentno results disclosedreferrals for carenot applicablecollecting and analyzing biological samples  methodvenipuncturedried blood spot  hiv testrapid testrapid test  hsv testkalon elisafocus elisafeasibility of collection methods  time20  min3  min  temperature for specimen transportcooler with no iceambienttesting costsreference labreference lab  bench fee , supplies , storage , labor us$ 5,784bench fee , supplies , labor us$ 8,000field site lab  sample processing , labor , supplies , storage us$ 3,611additional fee us$ 480  other supplies us$ 100  transportation us$ 375  total us$ 9,919total us$ 8,480 \n elisa enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay comparison of biomarker testing procedures in two research studies \n elisa enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay given the experience we have described , we conclude that it is feasible to obtain hiv and hsv-2 biomarker data for adolescent hiv prevention intervention studies . in particular the us pepfar program has accomplished considerable staff training in sub - saharan africa ; it has also stimulated the development of well - equipped laboratories , as well as useful tools for testing and protocols for improving test sensitivity , specificity , and cost ( stringer et al . , 2006 ) . in addition , it has stimulated the development of national guidelines ( particularly for adults ) for the disclosure of results . for hiv incorporation of hsv-2 serology results poses considerable challenges , particularly if results are disclosed to participants . based on our experience , there are two reasons why we do not recommend disclosing hsv-2 serology results to adolescent human subjects in sub - saharan africa . first , in populations with low or moderate prevalence of infection , as might be expected for adolescents , the potential for false positive test results is substantial in combination with relatively minor imperfections in test specificity . hsv-2 infection is often a silent disease , insofar as only 1025  % of people with antibodies for the condition are aware that they have genital herpes ( fleming et al . , 1997 ; leone , fleming , gilsenan , li , & justus , 2004 ; sizemore , lakeman , whitley , hughes , & hook , 2006 ) . adolescents without symptoms may deny ever having had sexual intercourse3 , further complicating the clinical picture and raising concerns about false positives with the potential for psychological and social harm related to participation in the study . second , local departments of health and sti authorities in sub - saharan african countries were much less familiar with hsv-2 pathology and treatment than with hiv and some other stis . even in cases where subjects acknowledge sexual exposure or genital herpes symptoms , local health clinics may not be prepared to provide appropriate treatment or care . given these vexing problems , the wisdom of disclosing hsv-2 results to adolescents after testing within a clinical prevention trial is questionable . in particular , decisions about whether to inform adolescent participants in prevention trials about hsv-2 test results should be made only after prevalence data are available and the predictive values of the test can be accurately assessed . in light of the feedback from the nih study section that raised concerns about possible stigma and abuse of hiv - positive participants in zimbabwe , as well as our own concerns , we recommend that more research be conducted to study the consequences of disclosure to adolescents in sub - saharan africa . a review of the literature indicates that sub - saharan adolescent prevention studies with biomarker outcomes have taken a variety of approaches to disclosure . in some studies , counselors disclosed participants hiv results immediately after rapid testing ( baird , garfein , mcintosh , & ozler , 2012 ; dalal et al . , 2012 ; medley et al . , 2012 ) . in other studies , participants could choose to receive their results after testing , either immediately or a few weeks later ( amornkul et al . , 2009 ; jewkes et al . , 2006 ; ross et al . , 2007 ) . in still other studies , the research did not provide test results but voluntary counseling and testing ( vct ) was made freely available for study participants ( birdthistle et al . none of these studies , however , examined whether adolescents experienced any untoward outcomes with testing and disclosure , whether hiv positive youth enrolled in care or took steps to prevent transmission , whether hiv negative youth benefited from prevention counseling and engaged in subsequent testing , or if adolescents and their guardians felt it was appropriate to learn their status in the context of a research study . from our kenya study , the problem of stigma did not appear to be a major obstacle to adolescent testing and disclosure in our study area . perhaps this is because hiv prevalence is among the highest in the country , and few families have been unaffected by hiv / aids . moreover , high hiv prevalence has drawn research , education , and hiv counseling and testing campaigns to the area . for example , in our kenya clinical trial , more than 50  % of participants ( all in grade 7 and 8) reported that they had previously been tested for hiv , mostly through a home - based testing initiative of the kenya medical research institute ( kemri ) and us centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) . although our study provided hiv test results to youth , we relied on phlebotomist / nurse counselors to refer youth and their guardians for care , following national guidelines . the onus of making contact with the clinic was left up to the individual and was not tracked by the system of care ; and follow up to make sure that hiv positive youth accessed care was well beyond the scope of our study . since it is unknown whether youth experience significant mental trauma and social prejudice , and whether they actually engage in the system of care , we recommend that further research be conducted to examine the perceptions and behaviors of youth  and particularly newly diagnosed youth  after disclosure of their test results to ascertain the consequences of this aspect of research participation and whether it can be improved . this is particularly important for adolescents , since results are disclosed in the presence of their guardian . regarding procedures for collecting biomarkers , we conclude that finger - sticks and dbs are overwhelmingly superior to venipuncture in sample collection efficiency and reduced burden on participants and community institutions . manufacturer validations of dbs for hsv-2 are urgently needed , however , for this procedure to be more widely accessible to researchers . because blood collection for dbs is minimally invasive , this procedure has excellent potential for widespread acceptability and consequent high participation in school and community research sites . in addition , rapid hiv testing in sub - saharan africa is typically conducted by finger prick , making this the preferred way for trained african health workers and counselors to participate in research data collection ( who , 2004 ) . given the complex decisions required for biomarkers , we recommend that behavioral prevention scientists interested in using biomarker data collaborate from the early planning stages with biomedical scientists who have expert knowledge in hsv-2 , as well as hiv , laboratory tests and testing procedures . we found that team members with such expertise provide valuable assistance in selecting qualified in - country laboratories , developing appropriate budgets , protocols , quality assurance and algorithms for interpreting results , and helping research staff to bridge communication with in - country laboratory staff . further , we recommend that hsv-2 test kit manufacturers determine optimal cut - off standards for sub - saharan populations , and that researchers who conduct hsv-2 testing explicitly define the testing cutoffs they use in publications . there is now a substantial literature documenting validity problems when using manufacturers cutoffs with african populations potentially inflating prevalence findings ( gamiel et al . , 2008 ; ngayo et al . , 2010 ; van dyck et al . , 2004 this suggests the need for action to improve assay validation practices on the part of manufacturers as well as methodological details from researchers documenting their findings . when conducting collaborative international research , it is important to recognize that alternative ethical systems exist . thus , for international research we recommend inclusion of team members who are knowledgeable about local contexts . indeed , successful collaborative research partnerships respect local cultures , values and practices ; negotiate effectively within these systems ; and incorporate into study designs ethical practices that are appropriate and sensitive to local cultural contexts ( e.g. , in our case , providing for husband consent for married participants ; christakis , 1992 ; emanuel , wendler , killen , & grady , 2004 ) . behavioral prevention scientists traditionally have relied on self - reported sexual behavior survey item measures to evaluate adolescent hiv prevention interventions . our experiences conducting research with orphan adolescents in kenya and zimbabwe suggest that collection of hiv and sti test results even in rural , resource - poor settings in sub - saharan africa is a feasible addition to the behavioral research toolkit . the use of sti biomarkers can greatly improve the validity of findings from adolescent behavioral intervention trials . research is urgently needed to examine the risks and benefits of hiv testing and disclosure of test results in the context of a research study for adolescents . further development and implementation of sti biomarker assessment techniques ", "output": " The main objective of this study is to address the feasibility of collecting biomarker data for HIV and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) as outcomes in prevention trials among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. The study presents two case studies of prevention trials with biomarker data collection among adolescents in Kenya and Zimbabwe. The study found that it is feasible to obtain HIV and HSV-2 biomarker data for adolescent HIV prevention intervention studies, particularly due to the efforts of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in training staff, developing laboratories, and improving testing protocols in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the study recommends against disclosing HSV-2 serology results to adolescent human subjects in sub-Saharan Africa due to the potential for false positive test results and the lack of preparedness of local health clinics to provide appropriate treatment or care. The study also found that finger-stick and dried blood spots (DBS) are superior to venipuncture in sample collection efficiency and reduced burden on participants and community institutions. The study recommends that further research be conducted to examine the consequences of disclosure to adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa, and that hsv-2 test kit manufacturers determine optimal cut-off standards for sub-Saharan populations. The study also emphasizes the importance of collaborating with biomedical scientists who have expert knowledge in HSV-2, as well as HIV, laboratory tests and testing procedures, and the need for action to improve assay validation practices on the part of manufacturers. The study also recommends the inclusion of team members who are knowledgeable about local contexts in international research.", "topic": "HIV/AIDS in sub Saharan Africa", "cat": []}
{"input": "assessment of myocardial viability in patients with coronary artery disease is of great clinical importance , as dysfunctional but viable myocardium has the ability to regain contractility after coronary revascularization with subsequent improvements in cardiac function and prognosis . the perfusable tissue index ( pti ) can be used as a marker of myocardial viability , having been validated in patients with ischaemic heart disease [ 27 ] . however , pti has never been used in clinical practice , primarily due to the complex imaging protocol consisting of dynamic [ o]h2o and [ o]co scans , together with a transmission scan , and the lack of high - quality , clinically usable parametric images . recently , however , a method was developed to derive the pti from a single [ o]h2o pet / ct scan . given the current potential of clinical [ o]h2o - based perfusion imaging and the rapid growth in the availability of cardiac pet / ct systems , pti viability measurements could become incorporated into clinical practice [ 9 , 10 ] . parametric pti images derived from [ o]h2o pet / ct scans , however , have not yet been validated . the purpose of this study was to compare these novel parametric pti images with late gadolinium - enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( lge - cmr ) imaging , an established method for quantifying scar size and a marker of viability . the study population comprised 46 patients with documented or suspected coronary artery disease who had been studied using both pet / ct and cmr within a 2-month period . all patients were in a stable clinical condition and no ischaemic events or revascularizations had occurred during the period between the two examinations . patients with contraindications for pet / ct or cmr ( e.g. pacemaker , claustrophobia , atrial fibrillation ) were excluded . the study was approved by the institutional medical ethics review committee , and all participants gave written informed consent prior to inclusion .

[ o]h2o is generally considered to be the gold standard for absolute quantification of myocardial perfusion in vivo [ 10 , 18 , 19 ] . apart from mbf , [ o]h2o also provides estimates of the extent of myocardium within a roi that is able to exchange water rapidly , i.e. ptf . subsequently , ptf can be corrected for partial volume effects by dividing it by its anatomical counterpart atf , resulting in pti . it has been shown that both ptf and pti can identify myocardial scarring and thus can act as markers of viability . only recently , however , a method has been developed that enables generation parametric atf , ptf and pti images from a single [ o]h2o pet / ct scan . in addition , the traditional ( long ) transmission scan can be replaced by a ( rapid ) low - dose ct scan , thereby shortening the total scanning time substantially . now that the method has been shown to produce high - quality parametric images , its implementation into clinical practice needs investigation . using the described parametric imaging approach , the present study demonstrated that atf was relatively constant independent of tissue characteristics of the myocardium . only in ( near ) transmurally infarcted segments was atf significantly reduced , most likely due to wall thinning , as atf is prone to partial volume effects . in contrast , ptf and pti progressively decreased with increasing extent of scarring , as shown by lge cmr . these results are in line with those of previous studies in which reductions in both ptf and pti were observed in nonviable scarred myocardium . pti in control segments appeared to be somewhat lower than the expected value of unity for normal segments ( 0.91    0.08 ) . this phenomenon has previously been observed in cardiomyopathy in both animal experiments and human studies [ 6 , 20 ] . slight misalignment between pet and cmr segments may have occurred to additionally account for this reduction in pti . furthermore , the presence of interstitial fibrosis in dilated cardiomyopathy may also explain this reduction in normal segments that remains undetected on lge cmr [ 21 , 22 ] . taking lge as a reference , the optimal cut - off values for discriminating between viable and nonviable myocardium although this would reduce the data processing time , it would not affect the scanning protocol , as for both parameters a dynamic [ o]h2o pet scan in combination with a low - dose ct scan are required . in addition , the sensitivity of pti exceeded that of ptf ( 91  % and 68  % , respectively ) , whereas for specificity the opposite pattern was observed ( 73  % and 78  % , respectively ) . although further study is need to determine the cause of this discrepancy , as a potential clinical marker of viability pti may be favoured over ptf to reduce false - negative findings in patients who might benefit from revascularization . it is of interest to note that , compared to ptf and pti , mbf performed relatively poorly in distinguishing viable from nonviable tissue , rendering it less suitable for viability imaging . previous studies have indicated that the optimal cut - off value for pti is in the range 0.70.9 . lge was used as a surrogate end - point of myocardial viability instead of functional recovery of dysfunctional myocardium after revascularization . lge has been shown to be a good , but not perfect , marker of myocardial viability [ 15 , 17 ] . therefore , the results should be interpreted with caution , and more studies are warranted to establish the value of parametric pti as a viability marker . ptf and pti , obtained from a single [ o]h2o pet / ct scan , can be used as markers of myocardial viability in patients with coronary artery disease . ptf and pti , obtained from a single [ o]h2o pet / ct scan , can be used as markers of myocardial viability in patients with coronary artery disease . this article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license which permits any use , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided the original author(s ) and the source are credited .", "output": " The study aimed to assess the validity of using a parametric myocardial viability imaging technique using oxygen-15 water positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in patients with ischemic heart disease. The researchers compared the results of this technique with late gadolinium-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance (LGE-CMR) imaging, a well-established method for quantifying scar size and a marker of viability.\n\nThe study population consisted of 46 patients with documented or suspected coronary artery disease who had undergone both PET/CT and CMR within a 2-month period. The PET/CT scans were acquired using a Gemini TF-64 scanner, and CMR studies were performed on a 1.5-T whole-body scanner.\n\nThe parametric PET/CT images were calculated using a basis function implementation of the standard single-tissue compartment model for oxygen-15 water. The researchers found that atf (anatomic tissue fraction) values remained relatively constant, except for a significant decrease in the (near) transmurally enhanced segments. In contrast, ptf (perfusable tissue fraction) and pti (perfusable tissue index) progressively decreased with increasing extent of scarring, as shown by LGE-CMR.\n\nThe study demonstrated that PET/CT-derived parametric images can be used as markers of myocardial viability in patients with coronary artery disease. The researchers suggest that pti (perfusable tissue index) may be favored over ptf (perfusable tissue fraction) as a potential clinical marker of viability to reduce false-negative findings in patients who might benefit from revascularization. However, further studies are needed to establish the value of parametric pti as a viability marker.", "topic": "Myocardial viability", "cat": []}
{"input": "while advances in free trade and globalization increase the movement and accelerate the accumulation of invasive species ( lockwood et al . 2005 ) , it is still unclear how introduced populations can successfully establish . as elton ( 1958 ) pointed out , for every successful invasion that occurs ,  there are enormously more invasions that never happen , or fail quite soon or even after a good many years ( page 109 ) . this modern biological paradox can not readily be reconciled , especially in the characteristic case where the founder population is small , as  such populations are definitely in a precarious position ( mayr 1965 ; page 42 ) . introductions of populations at low density and/or small size are often faced with inverse density dependent effects , attributed to demographic stochasticity or reduced cooperative interactions ( courchamp et al . allee ( 1931 ) first proposed that under these conditions , populations may suffer a decrease in the per - capita rate of increase , from here on referred to as the allee effect . upon arrival in a novel environment , individuals need to overcome a series of challenges in order to reduce the population 's risk of extinction . the time period in which this occurs is generally considered the initial establishment phase , and is thought to be a common feature and general pattern of invasion and the process of growth and expansion ( shigesada and kawasaki 1997 ; sakai et al . the occurrence of a lag phase that precedes a noticeable increase in population growth and density can result from ecological and/or evolutionary phenomena ( sakai et al . small populations that undergo logistic growth slowly increase through the initial phase of the exponential curve , leading to the perception of a time lag . where this time lag is more pronounced , populations may be recovering from inverse density dependent effects ( i.e. , allee effects ) . individuals may suffer a reduction in fitness at low densities for many reasons ( reviewed by courchamp et al . even when the initial population is large , rapid dispersal required for expansion could be suicidal as the population density decreases , thereby enhancing inverse density dependent effects ( lewis and kareiva 1993 ; drake et al . component allee effect where the population size and density affects the mean overall fitness or some component of individual fitness , respectively ( stephens et al . 1999 ; gascoigne et al . it is often difficult to decipher the exact mechanism that manifests allee effects ( and it is not always the case that component allee effects lead to demographic allee effects ) . nevertheless , we focus our attention on population level demographic allee effects with the underlying assumption that a component allee effect led to the demographic allee effect . essentially , it is the case that introduced individuals may be maladapted to small population sizes where their survival and reproductive ability are significantly impacted , and these impacts on individual fitness combine to produce an overall decrease in abundance ( i.e. , demographic allee effects ) . as allee effects impact individual fitness , the underlying traits that influence these effects ( i.e. , component allee effects ) may be subject to natural selection ( courchamp et al . 2008 ) . whereas propagule pressure is an emerging explanation for the establishment of invasive species ( lockwood et al . 2005 ) , it relies on an obvious relationship between the number and size of introduction events and the probability of success , as safety in numbers helps combat allee effects and stochastic extinction . in the event that propagule size is not large enough to overcome inverse density dependent effects , a population traits that may be responsible for reproductive success and survival at small population densities and sizes include mate finding cues ( pheromones and vocal / visual signals ) , dispersal / aggregation behavior , habitat preferences , mating synchronicity , and gamete morphology and performance ( see courchamp et al . direct evidence for the evolution of these traits as functional adaptations to allee effects is limited , but we can infer an adaptive evolutionary origin of these traits from studies of sexual selection ( courchamp et al . 2008 ; gascoigne et al . an evolutionary response to intensive selection pressure imposed by density dependent survival and reproduction relies on genetic variants for adaptive evolution . according to neutral quantitative genetic theory , a loss of genetic variation is expected from population bottlenecks and founder effects ( nei et al . however it is not neutral variation that matters , but rather evolvability depends on the variation relevant to selection . maintenance or even increases of this ( additive ) genetic variation has been theoretically and empirically observed following a bottleneck or in small founder populations ( bryant et al . 1986 ; goodnight 1988 ; willis and orr 1993 ; cheverud and routman 1996 ; briggs and goldman 2006 ; turelli and barton 2006 ) . additionally , many recent studies suggest that there is actually no significant reduction in genetic diversity in most successful invaders ( lee 2002 ; allendorf and lundquist 2003 ; roman and darling 2007 and references therein ) , and that evolution can occur on contemporary timescales ( reznick and ghalambor 2001 ; carroll et al . 2007 ; kinnison and hairston 2007 ) . our purpose here is to explore the feasibility of small populations that may adaptively respond to overcome allee effects in order to establish , given any amount of genetic variation . in this paper , we present evidence for the enhanced potential for growth and spread of a small introduced population of organisms faced with allee effects when adaptation occurs . we model the growth and spread of this population according to a reaction - diffusion equation , and allow evolution to influence inverse density dependent effects through a genetic subsystem that provides the opportunity for successful invasion when otherwise ( under the current , ecological paradigm ) the population would go extinct . the deterministic model that we explore in this paper broadly describes population dynamics with density - mediated growth ( i.e. , an allee effect ) and diffusive dispersal . this type of demographic model has been used as a compact and tractable representation of invasion ( e.g. , skellam 1951 ; lewis and kareiva 1993 ) . specifically , it has been applied to systems such as introductions of nonindigenous freshwater and marine species through ballast water discharge ( drake et al . 2005 ; drury et al . 2007 ) . using this approach , drake et al . ( 2005 ) report acceptable volumes of discharge for various organisms ( with differing reproductive rates ) for a range of invasion risk tolerances . here , we consider populations that are introduced below the invasion risk threshold , but nonetheless succeed if evolutionary dynamics are considered in conjunction with the ecological system . the growth and spread of an introduced population of organisms is represented by a reaction - diffusion equation described by ( lewis and kareiva 1993 ) : which determines the rate of change in the local population density relative to the carrying capacity [ u which denotes u(x , t ) ] over time , at a point in space . this equation models the growth of the population ( the first term on the right hand side of eqn . 1 ) at a spatial location that is subject to an allee effect in addition to migration ( which depends on the second term on the rhs of eqn . 1 ) . the diffusion coefficient ( d ) scales the rate of population spread , in this case across a one - dimensional habitat x. the reproductive rate is regulated by r , and a ( which is a function of space and time , derived below ) is the local critical density or allee threshold that determines if population growth is positive or negative ( fig . growth dynamics of the model population ( a ) , and the solution of eqn . ( 1 ) without diffusion ( b ) with reproductive rate , r = 0.6 , and allee threshold , a = 0.3 . trajectories for population size ( b ) are given for initial densities from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.05 . there are many variations of single - species models of population dynamics that exhibit allee effects ( see table 1 of boukal and berec 2002 ) , however the growth function of eqn . the behavior of this verhulst ( 1838 ) logistic model modified to include a nonlinear cubic term ( based on the fitzhugh - nagumo equations ; fitzhugh 1960 ; nagumo et al . 1962 ) , is bistable , with equilibria at u = 0 ( extinction ) , u = a ( unstable threshold ) , and u = 1 ( carrying capacity ) . figure 1a shows this behavior in terms of the growth of the population ( change in population density with respect to time ) versus the population density . at densities below the critical threshold ( a ) there is negative population growth declining to extinction ( from here on the population is considered extinct below a cutoff density of 0.0001 , as a declining population trajectory will only asymptotically approach zero in a deterministic model ; gomulkiewicz and holt 1995 ) ; otherwise the population will reach carrying capacity . 1b with the graph of the solution of the growth function ( population size versus time ) at various initial densities . when diffusion is added to this model of population growth , there are two critical elements that emerge based on the solution to the partial differential equation ( pde ) . the first is the wave speed , which is determined by the allee threshold ( a ) . as we are considering a strong allee effect in this model ( i.e. , 0 < a < 1 , where the population below this threshold exhibits negative growth versus reduced positive growth from a weak allee effect ) , there exists a unique wave speed of the invasion front that is a result of being pushed from the inside out , as opposed to being  pulled by the leading edge ( lewis and kareiva 1993 ) . this velocity can be derived through the solution of the pde ( 1 ) :   ( lewis and kareiva 1993 ; murray 1993 ) . this result suggests that in order for a wave to maintain a positive velocity of advance , the magnitude of the allee threshold ( a ) must be less than half of the maximum value of the population density relative to the carrying capacity . in addition to the velocity of the wave front , the region occupied by the invading population must exceed a certain critical size for positive growth to occur ( skellam 1951 ; kierstead and slobodkin 1953 ) . this phenomenon is clearly explained by okubo ( 1980 ) by noting that whereas reproduction takes place within a region or patch , diffusion takes place at the boundaries resulting in a loss of organisms , thus reducing the density within the patch . this tradeoff in the ratio of inner region volume to outer surface area will either allow a population to grow or decline with an inverse relationship of diffusivity to rate of growth . this relationship gives a minimum region within which reproduction can not compensate for loss due to diffusion , especially when allee effects influence population growth . thus , lewis and kareiva ( 1993 ) derive a minimum size condition ( i.e. , the radius of the initial beachhead ) based on the wave speed that is required for the population to establish and radially expand . we address this critical size threshold qualitatively , as the analytical solution ( i.e. , ;

( 1 ) without diffusion ( b ) with reproductive rate , r = 0.6 , and allee threshold , a = 0.3 . trajectories for population size ( b ) are given for initial densities from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.05 . there are many variations of single - species models of population dynamics that exhibit allee effects ( see table 1 of boukal and berec 2002 ) , however the growth function of eqn . the behavior of this verhulst ( 1838 ) logistic model modified to include a nonlinear cubic term ( based on the fitzhugh - nagumo equations ; fitzhugh 1960 ; nagumo et al . 1962 ) , is bistable , with equilibria at u = 0 ( extinction ) , u = a ( unstable threshold ) , and u = 1 ( carrying capacity ) . figure 1a shows this behavior in terms of the growth of the population ( change in population density with respect to time ) versus the population density . at densities below the critical threshold ( a ) there is negative population growth declining to extinction ( from here on the population is considered extinct below a cutoff density of 0.0001 , as a declining population trajectory will only asymptotically approach zero in a deterministic model ; gomulkiewicz and holt 1995 ) ; otherwise the population will reach carrying capacity . 1b with the graph of the solution of the growth function ( population size versus time ) at various initial densities . when diffusion is added to this model of population growth , there are two critical elements that emerge based on the solution to the partial differential equation ( pde ) . the first is the wave speed , which is determined by the allee threshold ( a ) . as we are considering a strong allee effect in this model ( i.e. , 0 < a < 1 , where the population below this threshold exhibits negative growth versus reduced positive growth from a weak allee effect ) , there exists a unique wave speed of the invasion front that is a result of being pushed from the inside out , as opposed to being  pulled by the leading edge ( lewis and kareiva 1993 ) . this velocity can be derived through the solution of the pde ( 1 ) :   ( lewis and kareiva 1993 ; murray 1993 ) . this result suggests that in order for a wave to maintain a positive velocity of advance , the magnitude of the allee threshold ( a ) must be less than half of the maximum value of the population density relative to the carrying capacity . in addition to the velocity of the wave front , the region occupied by the invading population must exceed a certain critical size for positive growth to occur ( skellam 1951 ; kierstead and slobodkin 1953 ) . this phenomenon is clearly explained by okubo ( 1980 ) by noting that whereas reproduction takes place within a region or patch , diffusion takes place at the boundaries resulting in a loss of organisms , thus reducing the density within the patch . this tradeoff in the ratio of inner region volume to outer surface area will either allow a population to grow or decline with an inverse relationship of diffusivity to rate of growth . this relationship gives a minimum region within which reproduction can not compensate for loss due to diffusion , especially when allee effects influence population growth . thus , lewis and kareiva ( 1993 ) derive a minimum size condition ( i.e. , the radius of the initial beachhead ) based on the wave speed that is required for the population to establish and radially expand . we address this critical size threshold qualitatively , as the analytical solution ( i.e. , ; lewis and kareiva 1993 ) is for two - dimensional spread , while we work with a simpler one - dimensional model . the minimum critical radius is proportional to the ratio of diffusivity ( i.e. , diffusion coefficient , d ) to the reproductive rate ( controlled by r ) . the inclusion of diffusion in the model provides a spatially explicit understanding of how all of the components interact to affect invasion / establishment success . the diffusion process has been extensively analyzed in invasion processes ( e.g. , fisher 1937 ; skellam 1951 ; okubo 1980 ) . in order to incorporate evolutionary factors that may influence invasion success , we develop a quantitative genetic subsystem . this genetic subsystem is coupled to the ecological model to explore the effects of selection and genetic variance on traits that may increase a population 's likelihood of survival . specifically , we allow the allee threshold to become a dynamic parameter that is considered to be a fitness related trait ( e.g. , a trait impacting the component allee effect ) . from here on , except in the absence of evolution , referring to the allee threshold implies that that value is the initial value , as it changes over time . this quantitative trait influences an organism 's ability to survive and reproduce in a small population . the results reveal the possibility that an introduced population that would fail to persist in the ecological context of this model has the potential to succeed through evolutionary means . including evolution within the context of ecological invasions can serve to provide more robust predictions for management strategies . therefore , it is important to investigate the possibility of evolution in the analysis of invasions . the framework that is used to link evolutionary change with ecological processes involves developing a relationship between the fast , ecological and slow , evolutionary timescales in order to make these rates comparable ( kondrashov and khibnik 1996 ) . in the coupled evolutionary ecology model , the reaction - diffusion eqn .

( 2 ) is negative , and decreases the mean allee threshold ( a ) , as the intensity of selection is density dependent . thus , fitness increases as allee effects are suppressed , and selection drives the allee threshold towards zero . if the population density is greater than the allee threshold , but still below the carrying capacity , it will progress towards carrying capacity more rapidly than it would without evolution as a decreases ; as the rate at which the population density changes ( eqn . 1 ) is proportional to the difference between u and a. the ecological dynamics are reversed when the population density is below the allee threshold as the population declines towards extinction , but more slowly than it does without evolution . when u < a , eqn . ( 1 ) is negative , and the population density approaches extinction more rapidly with a constant ( as the difference between u and a increases ) , than it does with evolution as a decreases ( revealing a more pronounced time lag to extinction ) . during this time lag , as the population slowly declines , the opportunity for evolution to overcome inverse density dependent effects occurs . if the rate of evolution is fast enough , the allee threshold can fall below the population density , causing the rate of change of population density to become positive ( where u > a ) and the population grows and can successfully invade . the chance that evolution can rescue the population from extinction depends on the relative rates of genetic change in the quantitative trait ( i.e. , allee threshold ) and of population decline ( gomulkiewicz and holt 1995 ) ; hence the amount of genetic variance greatly impacts the ability to adapt and survive . a nonspatial example of this process , referred to as evolutionary rescue ( gomulkiewicz and holt 1995 ) , is shown in fig . 2 , where a population is introduced below the allee threshold . without evolution , the population declines to extinction ( fig . 2a , solid line ) as the allee threshold remains constant ( fig . 2b , solid line ) . when the population can evolve ( fig . 2 , dotted line ) , it declines at first until it can overcome the magnitude of inverse density dependence , and is then able to successfully establish . as it is difficult to measure the allee effect empirically ( tobin et al . 2007 ) , we use an extreme value that exaggerates density dependent effects in order to investigate the  worst case scenario ( a = 0.3 , where the population exhibits deterministic decline when its density is less than 30% of its carrying capacity ) . when evolution is included , we used a small value for the genetic variance ,  = 0.02 , in order to remain consistent with fast - slow dynamics , unless otherwise indicated . comparison of an invading population introduced at a density below the allee threshold , a = 0.3 ( u = 0.25 , r = 0.6 ) . the solid line represents the nonspatial system ( d = 0 ) described by eqns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) without evolution (  = 0 ) which results in extinction ( a ) and a constant allee threshold ( b ) . the dotted line indicates population growth ( a ) when evolution (  = 0.02 ) acts to reduce the allee threshold ( b ) . in general , there is a range of parameter space that permits persistence for a population below the allee threshold in the nonspatial model with evolution ( instead of simple decline to extinction ) . as genetic variance increases , we are essentially relaxing the assumption of fast - slow timescales and allow evolution to occur more rapidly . 3 where initial population densities below the allee threshold require a minimum amount of genetic variance in order to avoid extinction . in this case , the rate of reproduction , r , also influences the potential for evolutionary rescue , as it impacts both population growth and rate of evolution ( eqns 1 and 2 , respectively ) . as we relax the assumption of fast - slow timescales , the behavior remains qualitatively the same as that described analytically under a strict fast - slow timescale assumption . parameter combinations of reproductive rate : r ; genetic variance :  , and initial population density : u , that result in extinction or evolutionary rescue . in this nonspatial scenario , initial population densities greater than the allee threshold ( a = 0.3 ) always succeed , thus the focus is on the parameter space that allows for evolutionary rescue ( i.e. , where the population growth changes from negative to positive ) . as the reproductive rate increases from 0.1 to 1 , there is less genetic variance needed for a population to evolve to overcome inverse density dependence as increased reproduction will contribute to suppressing allee effects . nonetheless , the additional complexities result in qualitatively similar behavior to the nonspatial model . in this case , not only will evolution influence population growth , it affects the wave speed and the critical size threshold , rmin . as the population overcomes allee effects with a decreasing allee threshold , the wave speed accelerates and the critical patch size becomes smaller . thus , in addition to the initial density of the introduced population and the genetic variance , the initial radius or patch size of the initial invasion area , the ratio of diffusion to reproduction , and gene flow will factor into successful establishment and give rise to a wider range of interactions between the ecology and evolution of this system . ( 1 ) ( without the evolutionary subsystem ) in one - dimensional space , with an initial population density below the allee threshold , declines to extinction ( fig . this is contrasted by the results when the evolutionary subsystem is included . with the initial population density below the allee threshold , fig . the same type of rescue occurs for a population that starts near carrying capacity , but occupies an initial spatial size below that which is necessary for a population to successfully establish . figure 5a shows a rapidly declining population that g", "output": " Objective: The main objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of small populations that may adaptively respond to overcome Allee effects in order to establish, given any amount of genetic variation.\n\nBackground: The modern biological paradox of successful invasions despite the precarious position of small founder populations is not readily reconciled. The study focuses on population-level demographic Allee effects, which are assumed to be caused by component Allee effects that impact individual fitness.\n\nMethods: The study presents evidence for the enhanced potential for growth and spread of a small introduced population of organisms faced with Allee effects when adaptation occurs. The growth and spread of this population are modeled according to a reaction-diffusion equation, and evolution is allowed to influence inverse density-dependent effects through a genetic subsystem.\n\nKey Findings: The results reveal the possibility that an introduced population that would fail to persist in the ecological context of this model has the potential to succeed through evolutionary means. Including evolution within the context of ecological invasions can serve to provide more robust predictions for management strategies.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that adaptations that enable organisms to overcome the negative effects of low densities can allow the population to rebound from a trajectory toward extinction to grow to reach carrying capacity. Current management strategies are based on ecological theory, but this evolutionary ecology model suggests that adaptive evolution can enable successful establishment and that ecological considerations alone may not be sufficient.\n\nClinical Relevance: The study's findings impact medical practice or patient care by suggesting that even small founding populations may have sufficient genetic variation to evolve to overcome Allee effects and establish, contrary to solely ecologically based predictions.

{"input": "an infliction in the life expectancy figure of patients with sickle cell disease ( scd ) occurred around the middle of the 1970s ( fig . this minimal increase in life expectancy coincided with my appointment at thomas jefferson university as the associate director of the newly created adult sickle cell center . the number of adults at that time was small and the transition from pediatrics to adult programs was at the age of 18 years . the trickle of patients increased gradually and we were faced with adolescent and young adult african american patients who were in a state of confusion . stripped from the protective sphere of the pediatric world and the empathy of their pediatric hematologists and the pediatric ancillary staff , they were in a state of fear , anxiety , depression and , worst of all , severe pain . the fact that most patients were barely educated , many without a high school degree , unemployed , mediocre health coverage , and dysfunctional family structure conferred a logarithmic dimension to the problem . the arrow indicates the infliction point where life expectancy of patients with sickle cell disease began to increase . the steady stream of admissions of patients with acute painful vaso - occlusive crises ( vocs ) to the emergency department ( ed ) and hospital were not welcome by most providers , hospital administration , the house and nursing staffs . there was subtle resentment of the patients that sometimes extended to the hematologists who showed compassion to the patients . soon labels such as drug addicts , drug - seeking behavior , and hospital hopping and frequent flyer emerged . listening to and believing the patients and keeping detailed records of ed and hospital admissions and the analgesics prescribed , revealed that most patients genuinely do not respond to a certain analgesic or a certain dose . increasing the doses of an analgesic or switching to another drug solved the problem in most patients . accordingly and with the approval of the institutional review board ( irb ) , i issued an identification wallet - sized , plasticized card that was carried by patients and presented to the provider treating their voc in the ed , hospital or any other medical facility . information printed on both sides of the card included : 1 ) demographic data and a recent photograph ; 2 ) hematological data including reticulocyte count ; 3 ) medical data including the type of scd , its complications and co - morbidities if present ; 4 ) all medications being taken by the patient and the recommended treatment of vocs including the name , dose , and the route of administration of the analgesics in question ; and 5 ) my name and contact information for answering questions if needed . it was not expensive to issue these cards . a polaroid camera available at that time and a laminator were the only equipments needed to issue these cards . later on , information on the card was computerized and a printed copy was given to the patient . the patients were very compliant in carrying it as faithfully as they carry their medical cards . some providers liked it very much because it facilitated having a concise history about the patients . while this controversy was brewing , interesting developments in basic science were in progress to understand the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of opioids . in the 1970s , it was hypothesized that opioids have receptors to bind to and activate in order to relieve pain   by blocking or minimizing the transmission of painful stimuli and raising the pain threshold . it did not take long after that to identify opioids as ligands that bind to stereospecific and saturable receptors in the central nervous system and other tissues [ 3 , 4 ] . in addition , recent elegant studies [ 6 - 10 ] have revealed a helical structure of the opioid receptors , which forms pockets in which the corresponding opioid ( ligand ) fits snugly ( fig . recognition is highly specific , such that only l - isomers of certain opioids exert analgesic activity . physiologically , by binding to receptors , opioids initiate a series of biochemical events including activation of g proteins , inhibition of adenylate cyclase , and extrusion of potassium ions , resulting in hyperpolarization of cell membranes [ 14 - 16 ] ; this delays or prevents transmission of painful stimuli . thus , the riddle why some patients respond to one opioid but not another had a pathophysiologic explanation . ( a ) morphine - like molecule ( yellow ) in the deep pocket ( blue ) of the -opioid receptor . ( b ) -opioid receptors from an intimate pair when crystallized with a ligand ( yellow ) such as morphine . knowing how an opioid molecule ( yellow ) sticks in the pocket of its receptor ( blue ) parallel to the progress in the pharmacodynamics of opioids mentioned above , a concomitant advance in the pharmacokinetics of opioids was bubbling to the surface . phase i involves the cyp enzymes and phase ii metabolism conjugates the drug to hydrophilic substances , such as glucuronic acid , sulfate , glycine , or glutathione . morphine , hydromorphone and oxymorphone are metabolized by glucuronidation , whereas the majority of the other opioids are metabolized by the cytochrome p450 isoenzyme system . the net effect of an opioid depends on the availability of enzyme(s ) to convert it into metabolites that could be active or inactive . briefly , the cyp2d6 genotypes are categorized into phenotypes based on the activity of the variant enzymes . ultrarapid metabolizers ( ums ) have greater than normal activity due to duplication or triplication , of active alleles [ 20 - 23 ] , extensive metabolizers ( ems ) have normal enzyme activity , intermediate metabolizers ( ims ) have decreased enzyme activity , and poor metabolizers ( pms ) have absent or little enzyme activity . patients who are ums of fentanyl would rapidly convert it into inactive metabolites with minimal or absent analgesic effect requiring increasing the dose of fentanyl . on the other hand , patients who are pms of fentanyl would experience prompt relief with relatively small doses of fentanyl but higher doses could be toxic due to the accumulation of unmetabolized fentanyl . the cyp3a4 enzyme metabolizes more than 50% of all drugs ; consequently , opioids metabolized by this enzyme have a high risk of drug - drug interactions . together , current data on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of opioids show great variability of genotypes among patients and extreme variability in individual responses to opioids . determining the pharmacogenetics profile of each patient facilitates the choice of drugs that would be efficacious for that patient and avoid those drugs associated with harmful drug - drug interaction . this approach in diagnostics and therapeutics ushers in the dawn of a new field for the management of individual patients based on their unique pharmacogenetics , phenotypic and biomarker characteristics . this future approach is referred to as personalized medicine or , more recently , precision medicine . we hope that this methodology would be approved and sponsored by the insurance companies for patients with scd . in the meantime , listening , believing and respecting the patient with sickle cell pain should be maintained for now as the approach to individualized therapy .", "output": " Objective: The main objective of the study is to understand the reasons behind the variable responses to opioids among patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and to propose a solution for individualized therapy.\n\nBackground: The study is set in the context of a minimal increase in life expectancy of SCD patients around the middle of the 1970s, coinciding with the author's appointment at Thomas Jefferson University. The author observed a state of confusion, fear, anxiety, depression, and severe pain among adolescent and young adult African American SCD patients transitioning from pediatric to adult programs. The author also noted the emergence of labels such as drug addicts, drug-seeking behavior, and hospital hopping and frequent flyer, which were attributed to the patients' genuine lack of response to certain analgesics or doses.\n\nMethods: The study design is not explicitly stated, but the author describes their approach to understanding the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of opioids. The author issued an identification wallet-sized, plasticized card that was carried by patients and presented to the provider treating their VOC in the ED, hospital, or any other medical facility. The card included demographic data, hematological data, medical data, all medications being taken by the patient, and the recommended treatment of VOCs including the name, dose, and the route of administration of the analgesics in question.\n\nKey Findings: The study reveals that the variable response to opioids among SCD patients has a pathophysiologic explanation. Opioids have receptors to bind to and activate in order to relieve pain by blocking or minimizing the transmission of painful stimuli and raising the pain threshold. Recent studies have revealed a helical structure of the opioid receptors, which forms pockets in which the corresponding opioid (ligand ) fits snugly. The net effect of an opioid depends on the availability of enzyme(s) to convert it into metabolites that could be active or inactive. The CYP2D6 genotypes are categorized into phenotypes based on the activity of the variant enzymes. Ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs) have greater than normal activity due to duplication or triplication of active alleles, extensive metabolizers (EMs) have normal enzyme activity, intermediate metabolizers (IMs) have decreased enzyme activity, and poor metabolizers (PMs) have absent or little enzyme activity.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that determining the pharmacogenetics profile of each patient facilitates the choice of drugs that would be efficacious for that patient and avoid those drugs associated with harmful drug-drug interaction. This approach in diagnostics and therapeutics ushers in the dawn of a new field for the management of individual patients based on their unique pharmacogenetics, phenotypic, and biomarker characteristics. This future approach is referred to as personalized medicine or, more recently, precision medicine.\n\nClinical Relevance: The study's findings have significant implications for medical practice and patient care. Determining the pharmacogenetics profile of each patient can help in choosing the right opioid for that patient, avoiding harmful drug-drug interactions, and improving pain management in SCD patients. The author hopes that this methodology would be approved and sponsored by the insurance companies for patients with SCD.

the absorption rate of the air is 1.25% ( 5075 ml / day ) . if pneumothorax affects > 20% of the lung or if it increases during observation , chest tube drainage may be required . air leakage can be diminished in 5 h and in 48 h in 52 and 82% of patients with tube thoracostomies , respectively . in patients with bpsp , one side should always be drained regardless of the extent of pneumothorax , whereas the other side can be managed by simple observation depending on the extent of the air in the pleura space . prolonged air leakage is the most common indication for operation in the first episode of pneumothorax . today compared with open thoracotomy , this procedure provides visualization of the entire thoracic cavity by video and causes less postoperative pain . single - stage bilateral vats procedure for bpsp has been advocated as an elective procedure to avoid subsequent anesthetic and operative procedures and longer hospital stays . if any underlying pulmonary disease is detected during surgical treatment , the existence of pleural communications should be investigated and mediastinal pleura should be examined carefully . in addition , apical pleurodesis further reduces the risk of recurrence . in our case , the patient was successfully managed initially with a bilateral tube thoracostomy and finally with an elective bilateral vats procedure . in conclusion , bpsp is a rare clinical condition and usually develops in patients with low bmi and bilateral blebs / bullae . bpsp in overweight - obese patients is an existing condition and its early diagnosis requires high suspicion index . bpsp needs urgent assessment and management , followed by bilateral single - stage vats treatment as a safe and effective procedure .", "output": " Objective: The main objective of this study is to present a rare case of bilateral primary spontaneous pneumothorax (bpsp) in an overweight young male patient and discuss its management and clinical relevance.\n\nBackground: Bilateral primary spontaneous pneumothorax (bpsp) is a very rare clinical condition, with an occurrence ranging from 1.3 to 1.9% of all cases of spontaneous pneumothorax (sp). Spontaneous pneumothorax usually occurs in young, tall, thin men, especially smokers, in the absence of an underlying lung disease. However, blebs and bullae apparently play a role in the pathogenesis of psp, as they are found on CT or during thoracoscopy or thoracotomy in 48-79% of these patients.\n\nMethods: The study presents a case of a 20-year-old, overweight (BMI 29.8 kg/m) Greek male patient who was presented to the emergency department complaining of low-intensity chest pain and breathlessness of progressive worsening over the preceding 7 days. The patient was managed with bilateral tube thoracostomy through the fifth intercostal spaces. During hospitalization, both lungs were gradually expanded, and the use of continuous aspiration was necessary for a couple of days to achieve complete expansion of the left lung. A chest computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed the presence of blebs at the apices of both upper lungs. The patient was referred to a tertiary center for an elective video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery intervention (VATS).\n\nKey Findings: The study found that the incidence of bpsp was 1.6% (13 patients) in a study of 616 patients with 807 episodes of psp. In univariate regression analysis, patients with psp compared with patients with bpsp had significantly lower body weight, BMI, higher body height/body weight ratio, and higher incidence of bilateral blebs/bullae seen in HRCT. However, in multiple regression analysis, only BMI and the presence of bilateral blebs/bullae retained statistically significant importance.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that bpsp is a rare clinical condition and usually develops in patients with low BMI and bilateral blebs/bullae. Bpsp in overweight-obese patients is an existing condition, and its early diagnosis requires a high suspicion index. Bpsp needs urgent assessment and management, followed by bilateral single-stage VATS treatment as a safe and effective procedure.\n\nClinical Relevance: The study's findings impact medical practice or patient care by highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and management of bpsp in overweight-obese patients. The study also emphasizes the need for bilateral single-stage VATS treatment as a safe and effective procedure for managing bpsp.", "topic": "Pneumothorax", "cat": []}
{"input": "putting a halt to the rising trend in overweight prevalence has high priority in public health policy all over the developed world . prevention , preferably starting at an early age , is considered as the key strategy to achieve this goal , and considerable effort is put into the design of preventive measures .   whereas we know in general terms that overweight is the result of an unbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure , development of effective preventive measures requires a much more specific understanding .   specific dietary habits and ( in)activities associated with overweight risk in specific age groups need to be identified and their quantitative contribution to the overweight prevalence in the population needs to be assessed . in addition , we need to know whether the importance of specific behaviors for the development of overweight differs between sub groups in the population . it is well established that children from families with a low socio - economic status and children with overweight parents are at increased risk to develop overweight [ 39 ] . it is therefore particularly important to assess the role of behavioral risk factors specifically in these children , since they are the priority target groups for interventions to prevent and reduce overweight . the aim of this study was to identify specific behavioral risk factors for overweight in young children and to assess their quantitative contribution to the prevalence of overweight in the general population and in high risk sub groups . in a large population - based birth cohort , we prospectively investigated associations between dietary habits , screen time and physical activity when the children were 5 and 7 years old and overweight at the age of 8 years . we also assessed the role of these behavioral factors separately in high risk sub groups : children of mothers with overweight and children of mothers with low education . we estimated the reduction of overweight prevalence that could be achieved if the prevalence of risk factors would be reduced . the study population consisted of children who participated in the dutch prevention and incidence of asthma and mite allergy ( piama ) birth cohort study . the baseline study population consisted of 4146 pregnant women , recruited from the general population in 1996 - 1997 . postal questionnaires , including questions on the child 's lifestyle and health , were sent to the parents during pregnancy , at the child 's ages of 3 and 12 months , and yearly thereafter up to the age of 8 years . at the age of 8 years , the children were invited for a medical examination which included measurement of weight and height . the study protocol was approved by the medical ethics committees of the participating institutes , and all parents gave written informed consent . of the baseline population of 4146 pregnant women , 183 ( 5% ) were lost to follow - up before any data on the child had been collected . parental completed questionnaires from age 3 months to 8 years were available for 3934 , 3817 , 3694 , 3563 , 3518 , 3473 , 3373 , and 3269 children , respectively . when the medical examination of 8-year - old children was planned , 3668 children ( 93% of 3963 ) were still in the study , 3522 children were invited and 2214 participated ( 63% of those invited ) and had their weight and height measured . 146 of the 3668 children were not invited for the medical examination , although they were still participating in the study . in the majority of cases the reason for this was that their families had moved and were now living too far away from the study centers where the medical examination was conducted . complete data on overweight and risk factors were available for 1871 children ( 47% of the 3963 children in the study at birth ) . during the medical examination of the 8-year - old children , weight was measured to 0.1  kg and height to 0.1  cm by trained research staff using calibrated measuring equipment . from the weight and height measurements bmi ( body mass index : weight ( kg)/height ( m ) ) was calculated . overweight  and  obesity  were defined according to age and gender - specific international standards that use cutoff points equivalent to the 25  kg / m and 30  kg / m cut - offs that are commonly used for adults . the term  overweight  is used for the total group of children who were overweight , including those who were obese . for physical activity , 3 indicators were selected : time spent walking or cycling to school ( 3 categories ) , membership of a sports club ( yes / no ) , and time spent playing outside ( 3 categories ) .  screen time  ( 4 categories ) included time spent watching television , video 's , or at the computer . for dietary intake , 3 indicators were used : fast food consumption , snack consumption , and soft drink consumption . data on these exposures were obtained from the questionnaires administered at the ages of 5 and 7 years . these questionnaires contained a food frequency questionnaire with 40 different items and 5 answering categories per item ( ranging from  never in the last month  to  on 6 - 7 days per week  ) , which was used to construct the dietary exposure variables . for  fast food consumption a score was constructed based on the consumption frequencies of chips / french fries and of foods like hamburgers and hot dogs . snack consumption  was based on the reported consumption frequencies of 7 different foods / food groups including pie / cake , muffins , candy bars , sweets , chocolate , biscuits , and crisps . soft drink consumption  was based on the reported frequencies of consumption of 4 types of soft drinks . each of these variables was based on a number of different items , which differed with respect to their energy content . to be able to  add up the different items , total weekly energy intake from each item was calculated based on the reported frequencies , assuming average portion sizes and average energy content per portion . data on maternal education and maternal weight and height were obtained from the questionnaire completed when the child was 1 year old . maternal bmi was calculated from reported weight and height and overweight and was defined as a bmi 25  kg / m . the associations between the exposure variables and overweight at the age of 8 years were analysed by logistic regression , adjusted for gender and birth weight . exposure variables were constructed using the data collected at both the age of 5 and at the age of  7  years in order to obtain a more stable estimate of exposure during the years preceding the measurement of weight and height . walking / cycling to school , playing outside and screen time were recorded in categories , numbered 1 , 2 , and 3 for walking / cycling to school , 1 , 2 , and 3 for playing outside , and 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 for screen time ( see table 1 ) . the data collected at the ages of 5 and 7 years , were combined by taking the mean of the numbers of the categories reported at the ages of 5 and 7 years respectively . this resulted in ordinal variables with 5 categories for walking / cycling to school ( ranging from never at ages 5 and 7 to > 1/2 an hour per day at both ages ) , 5 categories for playing outside ( ranging from < 1  x per week at ages 5 and 7 to > 3  x per week at both ages ) and 7 categories for screen time ( ranging from < 1/2 an hour per day at ages 5 and 7 to > 2 hours per day at both ages ) . after having checked for nonlinearity fast food , snack and soft drink consumption at age 57 ( the mean of the consumption scores at age 5 and at age 7 ) , were included in the regression analyses as linear variables , but are shown in categories ( tertiles ) in table 1 . overweight ( including obesity ) was used as the outcome measure in the regression analyses . the number of obese children was too small for analyses with fully adjusted regression models , and obesity was therefore not used as outcome measure in these analyses . in previous studies in the piama cohort , breast feeding was investigated in relation to overweight risk and was found to be associated with reduced overweight risk   [ 12 , 13 ] . although breastfeeding is not the subject of this study , results on breast feeding are shown in the tables for completeness . in additional analyses , the associations of physical activity and diet with overweight were also assessed separately for the exposures at age 5 and at age 7 . thirteen percent of all the data potentially in the study ( 3963 participants  20 variables   =   79260 ) were missing and 2092 children ( 53% ) had a missing value on at least 1 of the variables . if data are not  missing completely at random  ( mcar ) , complete case analysis may lead to biased results [ 14 , 15 ] .   in our dataset several variables ( including maternal education and breast feeding ) were associated with the probability of a subject having one or more missing values . missing data were multiple times imputed , using the  multivariate imputation by chained equations ( mice ) procedure   [ 16 , 17 ] , that runs under the statistical program r version 2.5.0   .   for the multiple imputation we used all the data that were used in the analyses , as well as data on the children 's weight and height that were measured and reported by the parents in the yearly questionnaires . .    maternal education and maternal overweight could be confounders of the associations studied but could also be factors in causal pathways . in addition , the analyses were repeated , stratified for maternal education , maternal overweight and gender . differences between the associations observed in the different sub groups were tested by inclusion of interaction terms in the regression models . for the behavioral risk factors that were found to be statistically significantly associated with overweight , adjusted population attributable risk percentages ( par% ) were calculated , using the mantel - haenszel approach , as described by benichou . table 1 shows characteristics of the study population and the prevalence of overweight and obesity in different sub groups . children with incomplete data on either risk factors or on measured weight and height at 8 years were compared to the children with complete data , with respect to a number of characteristics assessed during the first year of the study ( data not shown ) . children with incomplete data had , compared to children with complete data , a relatively high prevalence of low maternal education ( 27.5% versus 19.4% ) and of no breast feeding ( 19.7% versus 15.9% ) . as expected , in the imputed data the prevalence of these characteristics was somewhat higher ( 23.6% and 17.9% , see table 1 ) than in the children with complete data . the prevalence of maternal overweight was similar in children with incomplete data and in children with complete data ( 24.1% and 26.1% , resp . ) . the prevalence of overweight in the children was almost the same in the imputed data and in the complete cases ( 13.8% and 14.4% , resp . ) and the prevalence of obesity was the same in both datasets ( 2.7% ) . table 2 shows the associations between diet , physical activity , screen time and overweight . in the analyses adjusted for gender and birth weight only ( model 1 ) , fast food consumption and screen time , sports club membership , active transport to school , playing outside , snack consumption , and soft drink consumption were not associated with overweight . when all risk factors ( including breast feeding ) were included in the same regression model ( model 2 ) , the associations with overweight became somewhat weaker for most factors , indicating some association between the individual risk factors . the association of fast food consumption with overweight lost statistical significance in this analysis whereas the association with screen time remained statistically significant . surprisingly , an inverse association between snack consumption and overweight was observed .   in additional analyses , the analyses shown in table 2 were repeated with the behavioral risk factors measured at age 5 and ( separately ) with those factors measured at age 7 instead of the variables combining the exposures measured at age 5 and age 7 . for the physical activity indicators and for screen time , results of these analyses were similar to those shown in table 2 , showing associations between screen time and overweight ( aor ( 95% ci ) at age 5  :  1.35 ( 1.191.53 ) and aor ( 95% ci ) at age 7  :  1.22 ( 1.081.39 ) ) but not between the physical activity indicators and overweight . snack consumption at age 5 was not associated with overweight at the age of 8 years ( aor ( 95% ci ) : 0.87 ( 0.661.14 ) ) , but there was a significant inverse association between snack consumption at age 7 and overweight at the age of 8 years ( aor ( 95% ci ) 0.70 ( 0.540.91 ) ) . low maternal education and especially maternal overweight were strong predictors of childhood overweight ( see table 2 , model 1 ) . the association between low maternal education and overweight weakened substantially in the model including the behavioral risk factors ( an almost 25% change in the regression coefficient from 0.50 to 0.38 ) , indicating that these specific factors explain at least part of the excess overweight prevalence in children of mothers with low education ( see table 2 , model 3 ) . the association between maternal overweight and overweight in the child weakened only marginally in the model including behavioral risk factors ( 5% change in regression coefficient from 1.07 to 1.02 ) , indicating that the association between maternal overweight and overweight of the child is only to a limited extent mediated by the behavioral factors studied ( see table 2 , model 4 ) . the analyses were repeated after stratification for low maternal education , maternal overweight and gender , respectively . in the sub groups with low maternal education and with maternal overweight children of mothers with a low level education had a higher prevalence of high fast food and snack intakes , of > 2 hours screen time per day and of not being member of a sport club than children of more highly educated mothers ( see table 3 ) . children of overweight mothers had a higher prevalence of high fast food intake and of > 2 hours screen time per day ( at the age of 5 , but not at 7 years ) than children of normal weight mothers ( see table 3 ) . girls had a slightly higher prevalence of overweight and slightly less screen time than boys ( data not shown ) . the results suggest that the associations between screen time and overweight were weaker in children of mothers with overweight or low education than in children of mothers with a normal weight or higher level of education ( table 4 ) . interactions between the exposure variables and low maternal education and maternal overweight were not statistically significant , however . for boys and girls these associations were very similar ( data not shown ) . of the behavioral risk factors studied , only screen time was statistically significantly associated with overweight . based on the prevalence and adjusted odds ratios for screen time > 1  hr per day ( see table 5 ) , we estimated how much screen time contributed to the total prevalence of overweight . table 5 shows the adjusted population attributable risk percentage ( par% ) for a screen time of more than 1 hour per day at age 5 and/or age 7 as compared to less than 1 hour at both ages . of the total overweight prevalence in the low risk sub groups an estimated 17% could be attributed to screen time of > 1 hour per day as compared to 10% in the high risk sub groups . this means that , if all children would reduce their screen time to less than 1 hour per day , the following reductions in overweight prevalence could be achieved : from 18.3% to 16.4% in children of mothers with low education ; from 12.4% to 10.3% in children of mothers with higher education from 25.0% to 22.4% in children of overweight mothers and from 10.0% to 8.3% in children of normal weight mothers . all analyses were conducted in a data set containing only complete cases as well as in the imputed data . the odds ratios ( 95% ci ) for screen time , for example , were 1.47 ( 1.241.75 ) and 1.41 ( 1.171.70 ) in model 1 and model 2 , respectively , in the complete case analysis , compared to 1.45 ( 1.261.66 ) and 1.39 ( 1.211.61 ) in the analysis in the imputed data set . of 8 different potential behavioral risk factors , only screen time showed consistent and significant associations with overweight . in high risk sub groups of the population , screen time was higher than in low risk sub groups , but the associations between screen time and overweight were weaker ( although not significantly weaker ) in the high risk sub groups . important strengths of the study were the prospective design , the large study population , the repeated measurements ( at ages 5 and 7 ) of different behavioral risk factors and the availability of measured ( rather than parental reported ) data on weight and height.however , a number of limitations have to be considered . thirteen percent of our data were missing and 53% of the study population had a missing value on 1 or more of the variables used in the analyses . we used multiple imputation to deal with missing data in our study in order to avoid bias due to selective missing of data and to make more efficient use of the available data . results of the complete case analysis and the analyses in the imputed data sets were similar . information on the behavioral risk factors was obtained from parental completed questionnaires and we therefore need to address the possibility of misreporting . the questions asked ranged from simple matter - of - fact items ( like sports club membership yes / no ) to items that are more difficult to observe and recall accurately ( like the consumption frequency of a range of different food items ) . we expect that recalling or reporting problems will not have substantially influenced the data on sports club membership or transport to school and that any misreporting on these items will not have been systematically associated with overweight development . the data on foods and drinks consumption may well have been influenced by reporting bias . many of the foods included in the dietary variables have a bad reputation in relation to overweight , and selective underreporting by parents of children who were developing overweight may have occurred . another problem with respect to the diet variables is that data were available on the consumption frequencies of food items , but not on portion sizes . estimates of the intakes of fast food , snacks and soft drinks and the ranking of children according to their intakes were therefore based on reported consumption frequencies only , and the possibility of misclassification of food intake can not be excluded . membership of a sports club and active transportation to school were not associated with overweight in this population . the reason that we did not observe the hypothesized associations might be that in young children the duration and intensity of these activities are usually too low to have a sizeable impact on total activity . if this would be confirmed in further studies , it may have potentially important implications for the allocation of budgets for the prevention of overweight in this age group . in older children and adolescents active transport to school and sports club membership we found some evidence for an inverse relation between playing outside and overweight , but the associations were weak and not statistically significant . children who played outside 1  x per week seemed to have a higher overweight risk , but such children were a small minority in the study population . screen time was consistently and significantly associated with overweight and the association was largely independent of other lifestyle factors . a dose - response relationship was observed when it was included as a categorical variable in the regression analysis . our results thus suggest that , among the indicators of active and sedentary behavior that we studied , screen time is the most important risk factor for overweight in the age group studied . this result is in agreement with the conclusion of a recent study in which the evidence was summarized for six different strategies to prevent or treat pediatric overweight   . our findings on screen time and overweight risk are also in line with the results of a comprehensive meta - analysis on the subject , which observed a statistically significant relationship between tv viewing and body fatness among children and youth   . we estimated that a reduction in overweight prevalence of up to 2 percentage points could be achieved if all children would reduce their screen time to less than 1 hour per day . maximum achievable reduction of prevalence ( marp )  of 1.5 percentage points that was estimated for watching television > 1  hr / day in a study on 5 - 6 year old german children . consumption of soft drinks and fast food at ages 57 was not associated with overweight whereas an unexpected inverse association between snack consumption and overweight was observed . snack consumption at the age of 5 years was not associated with overweight at age 8 , but snack consumption at age 7 was inversely associated with overweight at age 8 . as indicated previously , these results may have been influenced by selective underreporting of snack consumption by parents of children who were becoming overweight . besides selective underreporting , reverse causation may also have played a role , in the sense that parents of children who were becoming overweight really have reduced their children 's consumption of specific foods and drinks . the results on fast food , snack and soft drink intakes seem to indicate that in particular the items included in our snack , variable are the kind of foods that come to parents ' minds when they think of trying to limit excessive weight gain in their child . the selective underreporting and reverse causation that are likely to be present in our dietary data , make it impossible to judge from our results how diet influences the development of overweight . we hypothesize that these mechanisms might play a role also in other epidemiological studies on diet and overweight . whereas , on theoretical grounds , it is hard to imagine that food intake is unrelated to weight status , observational studies have generally not produced consistent evidence for the expected associations [ 20 , 2327 ] . our results do not provide an answer to the question whether consumption of soft drinks , fast food , and snacks causes overweight but seem to indicate that parents may see reduction of snack consumption as a method to counteract the development of overweight . further studies into the strategies that parents themselves use to influence their children 's weight gain might provide insights that could be useful for the design of preventive strategies . low maternal education and maternal overweight were found to be strongly associated with overweight in the child . the association between low maternal education and overweight weakened substantially when the behavioral risk factors were included in the model , indicating that these factors explain part of the association . the behavioral risk factors had little influence on the association between maternal overweight and overweight in the child , indicating that other factors , possibly genetic factors , play a more important role in this association . we repeated the regression analyses in sub groups stratified by maternal weight status and maternal education . whereas in the high risk sub groups , screen time was higher than in low risk sub groups , the associations between screen time and overweight were weaker ( although not statistically significantly ) in these groups , and the population attributable risk percentage was lower than in the low risk sub groups . as the children of mothers with overweight and/or low education are the children at highest risk to develop overweight , this observation is potentially important for the development of preventive strategies and needs to be clarified in future observational as well as intervention studies . reduction of screen time should be part of interventions to prevent or reduce overweight in young children and could result in a reduction of overweight prevalence in the order of 2 percentage points in both high and low risk sub groups . our results also suggest however that interventions aimed to promote sports club membership , active transport to school , and playing outside may have little impact on the prevalence of overweight in this age group . the possibility that , due to reverse causation , associations between food intake and overweight can not be assessed in observational studies , needs further study .", "output": " Objective: The main objective of the study was to identify specific behavioral risk factors for overweight in young children and assess their quantitative contribution to the prevalence of overweight in the general population and high-risk subgroups.\n\nBackground: Preventing overweight, a significant public health issue in developed countries, is a priority. While it is known that overweight results from an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure, a more specific understanding is required to develop effective preventive measures. This study aimed to identify specific dietary habits and (in)activities associated with overweight risk in specific age groups and assess their quantitative contribution to overweight prevalence in the population.\n\nMethods: The study used a large population-based birth cohort, the Dutch Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA) study. Data was collected through postal questionnaires, including questions on the child's lifestyle and health, from pregnancy to age 8. At age 8, children were invited for a medical examination, which included weight and height measurements. The study population consisted of 4146 pregnant women recruited from the general population in 1996-1997.\n\nKey Findings: The study found that only screen time showed consistent and significant associations with overweight. Children in high-risk subgroups (children of mothers with low education and overweight mothers) had higher screen time than those in low-risk subgroups. However, the associations between screen time and overweight were weaker (although not significantly weaker) in high-risk subgroups.\n\nConclusions: The study concluded that screen time is the most important risk factor for overweight in the age group studied. Reduction of screen time should be part of interventions to prevent or reduce overweight in young children and could result in a reduction of overweight prevalence in the order of 2 percentage points in both high and low-risk subgroups.\n\nClinical Relevance: The study's findings suggest that interventions aimed at promoting sports club membership, active transport to school, and playing outside may have little impact on the prevalence of overweight in this age group. However, reducing screen time could significantly contribute to reducing overweight prevalence. The possibility that associations between screen time and overweight can not be assessed in observational studies needs further study.", "topic": "Childhood obesity", "cat": []}

Accurate and comprehensive cognitive assessment and treatment are required for successful rehabilitation. VR technology has been increasingly used as a tool for cognitive research, evaluation, and rehabilitation, as it allows users to interact in various sensory environments and obtain real-time feedback on their performance.\n\nMethods: The study reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and crossover studies that used VR programs for cognitive intervention in patients with brain injury. The inclusion criteria were subjects over the age of 19 with brain injury, articles written in English, and studies that used VR in cognitive rehabilitation. The exclusion criteria were subjects who were animals or children, review articles, and 2D computer-based cognitive rehabilitation. The methodological quality of the included studies was independently assessed by two authors, and disagreements were resolved by reaching consensus.\n\nKey Findings: Memory assessment was the most common study topic, followed by assessments of executive function and attention. A variety of VR programs were used, and the results showed that VR programs could distinguish the cognitive disability of patients in comparisons with healthy subjects. The five studies of cognitive therapy using VR all reported positive effects, with improvements in the areas of memory and attention but not executive function.\n\nConclusions: The results of this systematic review suggest that VR is an effective cognitive therapy for patients with brain injury compared to control therapy. However, there was a significant risk of bias with regard to allocation concealment and blinding. Well-designed RCTs and blind studies will be needed to provide evidence of the benefits of VR on cognitive function.\n\nClinical Relevance: The advantage of cognitive rehabilitation using VR is that it provides a variety of environments similar to those encountered in real life. Patients are more motivated in virtual environments than they are in conventional settings, and VR programs can be tailored to the type of injury and easily adjusted to the level of cognitive disability. VR systems are constantly evolving and becoming smaller and more easily adjustable, which can benefit patients who find it difficult to visit health care organizations.", "topic": "Virtual reality in healthcare", "cat": []}

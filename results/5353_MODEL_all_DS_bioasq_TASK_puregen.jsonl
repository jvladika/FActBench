{"input": "Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is a fairly frequent cause of intestinal obstruction in children. It is characterized as a sex-linked heterogonous disorder with variable severity and incomplete penetrance giving rise to a variable pattern of inheritance. Although Hirschsprung's disease occurs as an isolated phenotype in at least 70% of cases, it is not infrequently associated with a number of congenital abnormalities and associated syndromes, demonstrating a spectrum of congenital anomalies. Certain of these syndromic phenotypes have been linked to distinct genetic sites, indicating underlying genetic associations of the disease and probable gene-gene interaction, in its pathogenesis. These associations with HSCR include Down's syndrome and other chromosomal anomalies, Waardenburg syndrome and other Dominant sensorineural deafness, the Congenital Central Hypoventilation and Mowat-Wilson and other brain-related syndromes, as well as the MEN2 and other tumour associations On the other hand, about 30% of HSCR are syndromic. Hitherto, the disease causing gene has been identified for eight Mendelian syndromes with HSCR: congenital central hypoventilation (CCHS), Mowat-Wilson (MWS), Bardet-Biedl (BBS), Shah-Waardenburg (WS4), cartilage-hair-hypoplasia (CHH), Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO), Goldberg-Sprintzsen (GSS), and hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of the aqueduct of sylvius (HSAS) The syndromic HSCR entities studied were congenital central hypoventilation (CCHS) and Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS), caused by PHOX2B and ZFHX1B gene mutations, respectively The RET locus was genotyped in 143 CCHS patients, among whom 44 had HSCR, and in 30 MWS patients, among whom 20 had HSCR RET was shown to act as a modifier gene for the HSCR phenotype in patients with CCHS but not with MWS These associations with HSCR include Down's syndrome and other chromosomal anomalies, Waardenburg syndrome and other Dominant sensorineural deafness, the Congenital Central Hypoventilation and Mowat-Wilson and other brain-related syndromes, as well as the MEN2 and other tumour associations Hitherto, the disease causing gene has been identified for eight Mendelian syndromes with HSCR: congenital central hypoventilation (CCHS), Mowat-Wilson (MWS), Bardet-Biedl (BBS), Shah-Waardenburg (WS4), cartilage-hair-hypoplasia (CHH), Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO), Goldberg-Sprintzsen (GSS), and hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of the aqueduct of sylvius (HSAS).

In this overview we focus, however, on the epigenetic alterations elicited by EBNA1 by drawing a parallel between EBNA1 and the FoxA family of pioneer transcription factors. Both EBNA1 and FoxA induce local DNA demethylation, nucleosome destabilization and bind to mitotic chromosomes.  In addition, EBNA1 and FoxA, when associated with mitotic chromatin may \"bookmark\" active genes and ensure their reactivation in postmitotic cells (epigenetic memory) about one-third of the FoxA bound sites are near silent genes, including genes without detectable RNA polymerase II. We found one such target site at a cryptic \"shadow\" enhancer 7 kilobases (kb) downstream of the Cdx2 gene, where Rfx1 restricts transcriptional activation by FoxA Nuclear mobility and mitotic chromosome binding: similarities between pioneer transcription factor FoxA and linker histone H1 The results indicate that the \"pioneer\" features of FoxA factors involve various chromatin-binding parameters seen in linker histones and that distinguish the factors with respect to their regulatory and mechanistic functions. These discoveries followed the establishment of the conceptional framework of the mechanism of action of the FoxA proteins as 'pioneer factors' that can engage chromatin before other transcription factors. The purpose of this review is to critically examine the literature on three highly potent transcriptional activators: the herpes virus protein, VP16; the master regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation, MyoD and the \"pioneer\" factor for hepatogenesis, FoxA. Nucleosome-binding affinity as a primary determinant of the nuclear mobility of the pioneer transcription factor FoxA We find that slower nuclear mobility correlates with high nonspecific nucleosome binding, and point mutations that disrupt nonspecific binding markedly increase nuclear mobility. FoxA's distinct nuclear mobility is consistent with its pioneer activity in chromatin The Fox DNA-binding domain structurally resembles linker histone and binds nucleosomes stably Insight into the unique molecular basis of Foxa function has been obtained from recent genetic and genomic data, which identify the Foxa proteins as 'pioneer factors' whose binding to promoters and enhancers enable chromatin access for other tissue-specific transcription factors Nucleosome-binding affinity as a primary determinant of the nuclear mobility of the pioneer transcription factor FoxA. FOXO proteins represent a hybrid subclass having dual roles as pioneering factors and transcription factors. A subset of FOX proteins interacts with condensed mitotic chromatin and may function as &apos;bookmarking&apos; agents to maintain transcriptional competence at specific genomic sites.

{"input": "Endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) removes improperly-folded proteins from the ER membrane into the cytosol where they undergo proteasomal degradation.  In the secretory pathway, quality control for the correct folding of proteins is largely occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), at the earliest possible stage and in an environment where early folding intermediates mix with terminally misfolded species. An elaborate cellular mechanism aims at dividing the former from the latter and promotes the selective transport of misfolded species back into the cytosol, a step called retrotranslocation. During retrotranslocation proteins will become ubiquitinated on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane by dedicated machineries and will be targeted to the proteasome for degradation. The entire process, from protein recognition to final degradation, has been named ER-associated protein degradation, or simply ERAD. From the many cellular processes, Cdc48 is involved in, its function in endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation (ERAD) is understood best. This quality control process for proteins of the secretory pathway scans protein folding and discovers misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the organelle, destined for folding of these proteins and their further delivery to their site of action. Misfolded lumenal and membrane proteins of the ER are detected by chaperones and lectins and retro-translocated out of the ER for degradation.  After polyubiquitylation of the protein substrate, Cdc48 together with its dimeric co-factor complex Ufd1-Npl4 pulls the misfolded protein out and away from the ER membrane and delivers it to down-stream components for degradation by a cytosolic proteinase machine, the proteasome. Recognition and elimination of misfolded proteins are essential cellular processes. More than thirty percent of the cellular proteins are proteins of the secretory pathway. They fold in the lumen or membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum from where they are sorted to their site of action. The folding process, as well as any refolding after cell stress, depends on chaperone activity. In case proteins are unable to acquire their native conformation, chaperones with different substrate specificity and activity guide them to elimination. For most misfolded proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum this requires retro-translocation to the cytosol and polyubiquitylation of the misfolded protein by an endoplasmic reticulum associated machinery. Thereafter ubiquitylated proteins are guided to the proteasome for degradation. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway eliminates aberrant proteins from the ER. Terminally misfolded or unassembled proteins are degraded by the cytoplasmic ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in a process known as ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation). Endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) is a protein quality control mechanism that minimizes the detrimental effects of protein misfolding in the secretory pathway. Molecular chaperones and ER lumenal lectins are essential components of this process because they maintain the solubility of unfolded proteins and can target ERAD substrates to the cytoplasmic proteasome. Other factors are likely required to aid in the selection of ERAD substrates, and distinct proteinaceous machineries are required for substrate retrotranslocation/dislocation from the ER and proteasome targeting. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control processes recognize and remove aberrant proteins from the secretory pathway. Several variants of the plasma protein fibrinogen are recognized as aberrant and degraded by ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), thus leading to hypofibrinogenemia. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the eukaryotic organelle where most secretory proteins are folded for subsequent delivery to their site of action. Proper folding of newly synthesized proteins is monitored by a stringent ER quality control system. This system recognizes misfolded or unassembled proteins and prevents them from reaching their final destination. Instead, they are extracted from the ER, polyubiquitinated and degraded by the cytosolic proteasome. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, elicits an adaptive response, the unfolded protein response (UPR). One component of the UPR, the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) system, has an important function in the survival of ER stressed cells. Proteins that fail to fold properly as well as constitutive or regulated short-lived proteins of the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) are subjected to proteolysis by cytosolic 26 S proteasomes. This process, termed ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), has also been implicated in the generation of some important human disorders, for example, cystic fibrosis. To become accessible to the proteasome, ERAD substrates must first be retrogradely transported from the ER into the cytosol, in a process termed dislocation. Surprisingly, protein dislocation from the ER seems to require at least some components that also mediate import into this compartment. Moreover, polyubiquitination of ERAD substrates at the ER membrane as well as the cytoplasmic Cdc48p/Npl4p/Ufd1p complex were shown to contribute to this export reaction. Proteins that fail to fold properly as well as constitutive or regulated short-lived proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum are subjected to proteolysis by cytosolic 26S proteasomes. This process is known as endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation. In order to become accessible to the proteasome of this system substrates must first be retrogradely transported from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol, in a process termed dislocation. This export step seems to be accompanied by polyubiquitination of such molecules. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) disposes of aberrant proteins in the secretory pathway. Protein substrates of ERAD are dislocated via the Sec61p translocon from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol, where they are ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. Membrane and secretory proteins fold in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and misfolded proteins may be retained and targeted for ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). The endoplasmic reticulum contains a protein quality control system that discovers malfolded or unassembled secretory proteins and subjects them to degradation in the cytosol. This requires retrograde transport of the respective proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum back to the cytosol via the Sec61 translocon. In addition, a fully competent ubiquitination machinery and the 26 S proteasome are necessary for retrotranslocation and degradation. Ubiquitination of mutated and malfolded proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum is dependent mainly on the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc7p. In addition, several new membrane components of the endoplasmic reticulum are required for degradation. The quality control system in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells ensures that newly synthesized proteins that fail to fold into the correct conformation or unassembled orphan subunits of oligomeric proteins are rapidly eliminated by proteolytic degradation. This entails the export of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol followed by their destruction by the cytosolic ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. While this mechanism effectively prevents the cellular accumulation of non-functional or unwanted endogenous proteins, it renders the cell vulnerable to certain viruses and toxins that are able to subvert this degradative mechanism for their own advantage. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation. Until recently, the degradation of aberrant and unassembled proteins retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was thought to involve unidentified ER-localized proteases. We now show that the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of two mutant proteins that accumulate in the ER lumen is inhibited in a proteasome-defective yeast strain and when cytosol from this mutant is used in an in vitro assay. In addition, ERAD is limited in vitro in the presence of the proteasome inhibitors, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin and lactacystin. We conclude that lumenal ERAD substrates are exported from the yeast ER to the cytoplasm for degradation by the proteasome complex. Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are eliminated by a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which starts with misfolded protein recognition, followed by ubiquitination, retrotranslocation to the cytosol, deglycosylation, and targeting to the proteasome for degradation. Early secretory and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized proteins that are terminally misfolded or misassembled are degraded by a ubiquitin- and proteasome-mediated process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Proteins that fail to correctly fold or assemble into oligomeric complexes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are degraded by a ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Proteins that cannot fold properly will be directed to a process known as endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD). Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) is an essential quality control process whereby misfolded proteins are exported from the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded by the proteasome in the cytosol. Quality control mechanisms in the endoplasmic reticulum prevent deployment of aberrant or unwanted proteins to distal destinations and target them to degradation by a process known as endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, or ERAD. Proteins that fail to fold in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or cannot find a pattern for assembly are often disposed of by a process named ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which involves transport of the substrate protein across the ER membrane (dislocation) followed by rapid proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Quality control mechanisms in the endoplasmic reticulum prevent deployment of aberrant or unwanted proteins to distal destinations and target them to degradation by a process known as endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, or ERAD Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are eliminated by a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which starts with misfolded protein recognition, followed by ubiquitination, retrotranslocation to the cytosol, deglycosylation, and targeting to the proteasome for degradation Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are dislocated out of the ER to the cytosol, polyubiquitinated, and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system in a process collectively termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD) Eukaryotic organisms have evolved a highly conserved endoplasmic reticulum-mediated protein quality control (ERQC) mechanism to monitor folding processes of secretory and membrane proteins, allowing export of only correctly folded proteins to their physiological destinations, retaining incompletely/mis-folded ones in the ER for additional folding attempts, marking and removing terminally misfolded ones via a unique multiple-step degradation process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD) ", "output": " Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Protein Degradation (ERAD) is a cellular process that targets misfolded or damaged proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for degradation in the proteasome, a protein complex found in the cytoplasm.

With additional resistance mechanisms, tetA-carrying strains can reach the breakpoint for tigecycline resistance. Efflux pump inhibitors may inhibit the major AcrAB-TolC in Salmonella efflux systems which are the major efflux pumps responsible for multidrug resistance in Gram-negative clinical isolates. (RND)-type efflux transporters play the main role in intrinsic resistance to various antimicrobial agents in many gram-negative bacteria. Here, we estimated 12 RND-type efflux transporter genes in Vibrio parahaemolyticus. ", "output": "Molecular transporters, also known as efflux pumps, play a significant role in multi-drug resistance in bacteria. Here are some examples: |||  ||| 1. **Active efflux**: Bacteria can use transporters to actively pump antibiotics out of the cell, reducing their concentration and effectiveness. For instance, the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump in E. coli can expel a wide range of antibiotics, including beta-lactams, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones. ||| 2. **Multidrug resistance pumps**: Some transporters can recognize and transport multiple antibiotics, conferring broad-spectrum resistance. For example, the MexAB-OprM efflux pump in Pseudomonas aeruginosa can expel a variety of antibiotics, including beta-lactams, tetracyclines, and aminoglycosides. ||| 3. **Efflux pumps as a defense mechanism**: Bacteria can also use transporters to expel antibiotics that have entered the cell, reducing their effectiveness. For instance, the NorA efflux pump in Staphylococcus aureus can pump out fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin. ||| 4. **Co-transport of antibiotics and toxins**: Some transporters can co-transport antibiotics with toxins, which can enhance the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. For example, the RND-type efflux pump in Pseudomonas aeruginosa can co-transport antibiotics with the toxin pyocyanin, which can further reduce the effectiveness of antibiotics. |||  ||| These examples illustrate how molecular transporters can contribute to multi-drug resistance in bacteria, making it challenging to treat bacterial infections effectively.\n", "topic": "Efflux pump", "cat": []}
{"input": "The Barr body is the inactive X chromosome in a female somatic cell. It is readily identified as plano-convex structure of 2-3 micron in diameter on the periphery of the nuclear membrane.  Human inactive X chromosome (Xi) forms a compact structure called the Barr body, which is enriched in repressive histone modifications such as trimethylation of histone H3 Lys9 (H3K9me3) and Lys27 (H3K27me3).  In the late 1940s, a microanatomist from London Ontario, Murray Barr, discovered a mark of sex chromosome status in bodily tissues, what came to be known as the 'Barr body'. This discovery offered an important diagnostic technology to the burgeoning clinical science community engaged with the medical interpretation and management of sexual anomalies. Barr body is an inactivated X chromosome in the normal female somatic cell. Inactivation of these chromosomes is known as Lyonization. Lyonization has both genetic and clinical significance. Barr body can be easily identified with ordinary stains. It also helps in identifying the sex of an individual when used judiciously.  The Barr body has long been recognized as the cytological manifestation of the inactive X chromosome (Xi) in interphase nuclei. Despite being known for over 50 years, relatively few components of the Barr body have been identified. One of the X-chromosomes by a random inactivation process condenses to form X-chromatin (Barr body) in early embryonic life. Once this occurs, it is final and fixed for that cell and all its descendants (1,2). However, numerous investigators have observed extreme variations in Barr body frequency in tumour cells.

{"input": "Two different mechanisms convey DNA methylation information into the regulation of alternative splicing. The first involves modulation of the elongation rate of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2); the second involves the formation of a protein bridge by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) that recruits splicing factors onto transcribed alternative exons. Furthermore, we found mutations in the splicing factor SFPQ and in the nonclassic regulators of mRNA processing CTCF and RAD21.  We show that CTCF bound to HTLV-1 acts as an enhancer blocker, regulates HTLV-1 mRNA splicing, and forms long-distance interactions with flanking host chromatin.   Many CTCF sites are also involved in other functions such as modulation of RNA splicing and specific regulation of gene expression, and the relationship between these activities and loop formation is another unanswered question that should keep investigators occupied for some time. TET-catalyzed oxidation of intragenic 5-methylcytosine regulates CTCF-dependent alternative splicing. Intragenic 5-methylcytosine and CTCF mediate opposing effects on pre-mRNA splicing: CTCF promotes inclusion of weak upstream exons through RNA polymerase II pausing, whereas 5-methylcytosine evicts CTCF, leading to exon exclusion. Here, we reveal the methylcytosine dioxygenases TET1 and TET2 as active regulators of CTCF-mediated alternative splicing through conversion of 5-methylcytosine to its oxidation derivatives.  A chromatin code for alternative splicing involving a putative association between CTCF and HP1\u03b1 proteins. Recent experiments have suggested a new complex network of splicing regulation involving chromatin, transcription and multiple protein factors. In particular, the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), the Argonaute protein AGO1, and members of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family have been implicated in the regulation of splicing associated with chromatin and the elongation of RNAPII. Our results show that a considerable number of alternative splicing events could have a chromatin-dependent regulation involving the association of HP1\u03b1 and CTCF near regulated exons. Additionally, we find further evidence for the involvement of HP1\u03b1 and AGO1 in chromatin-related splicing regulation. CTCF also functions in RNA polymerase II regulation and in doing so can influence co-transcriptional splicing events.   CTCF is ubiquitously expressed and plays diverse roles in gene regulation, imprinting, insulation, intra/interchromosomal interactions, nuclear compartmentalisation, and alternative splicing. However, there was no correlation between the KTS+/KTS- splicing variants of WT1 and the methylation status of the CpGs of the CTCF binding site. CTCF-promoted RNA polymerase II pausing links DNA methylation to splicing. Here we provide the first evidence that a DNA-binding protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), can promote inclusion of weak upstream exons by mediating local RNA polymerase II pausing both in a mammalian model system for alternative splicing, CD45, and genome-wide ", "output": "According to my knowledge, CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating alternative splicing. It mediates splicing by binding to specific DNA sequences, known as CTCF-binding sites, which are often located near exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) or silencers (ESSs). |||  ||| When CTCF binds to these sites, it can either: |||  ||| 1. Enhance splicing by recruiting splicing factors, such as SR proteins, to the ESEs, promoting the inclusion of exons. ||| 2. Repress splicing by recruiting splicing factors, such as hnRNP proteins, to the ESSs, promoting the exclusion of exons. |||  ||| CTCF's binding to these sites can also influence the recruitment of other transcription factors, chromatin-modifying enzymes, and RNA-binding proteins, which can further regulate splicing outcomes. |||  ||| In summary, CTCF mediates splicing by binding to specific DNA sequences and recruiting splicing factors to modulate the inclusion or exclusion of exons.\n", "topic": "CTCF", "cat": []}
{"input": "Screening for early disease has been available for many years, but there is still no national screening programme established in the United Kingdom. Latest results from the UK trials evaluating prostate cancer screening and treatment: the CAP and ProtecT studies. The CAP and ProtecT trials (ISRCTN92187251 and ISRCTN20141217) will help resolve the prostate cancer screening debate, define the optimum treatment for localised disease and generate evidence to improve men's health. Increased usage of Prosdex leads to more informed decision making, the key aim of the UK Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme.  To date, the AIDIT team has established a website to facilitate communication between project collaborators (www.impact-study.co.uk), has been represented at several international meetings and has facilitated a conference for the IMPACT study to bring together international research teams, clinicians and policy makers.  This prospective questionnaire study was nested within the case-finding component of the ProtecT (prostate testing for cancer and treatment) feasibility study (ISRCTN20141297).  The UK NHS Executive has issued extensive guidance stressing the importance of adequate counselling prior to performing this test.  To examine the pattern of use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in a UK region, where National Health Service policy does not recommend screening for prostate cancer.  In all, 165 862 PSA tests were performed on 84 669 men, and over a third of men aged > or = 50 years had at least one PSA test. Men aged < 50 years accounted for 12.9% of first tests. The proportion of tests from primary care increased from 47.2% in 1993 to 67.0% in 1999. The mean age of men tested once decreased from 65.6 to 61.9 years (P trend < 0.001) and the proportion with an elevated PSA level also declined during the period. Repeat testing increased with PSA level (P < 0.001) but 29.4% of men with a PSA level of < or = 4 ng/mL also had repeat testing. Raised PSA values were more common from hospital than primary care (32.4% vs 20.6%, P < 0.001) and in older men. Test rates varied 100-fold across general practices, a finding not explained by sociodemographic factors, but one which reflects differential adherence to national guidelines, suggesting that general practitioners are key targets for attempting to rationalise the use of the PSA test.  These findings suggest that PSA screening is taking place against evidence-based advice and has resulted in over 20 000 men being designated as having a raised PSA level, creating a need for further assessment. There is no current prostate cancer screening programme in the UK.  Prostate cancer screening of asymptomatic men is not recommended by the National Screening Council at present and is not encouraged in the NHS. We used a nested case-control design on data from men in four prospective studies (from the UK, Maryland in the USA, and two from Finland) with available stored serum samples to determine whether there was an advantage in measuring both free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and total PSA as a potential screening test for prostate cancer. Some respondents were reluctant to give the leaflet to people enquiring about screening for prostate cancer, for example, because they thought that the leaflet would cause anxiety, or because prostate cancer screening was not freely available locally.  National guidance (executive letter) EL(97)12 stated that population screening should not be provided by the NHS, or be offered to the public until there is effective screening technology for prostate cancer.  This postal questionnaire survey reveals that 81% (95% CI 75% to 87%) of responding general practitioners in North Staffordshire agreed with EL(97)12 and one in ten said that the executive letter changed their views, suggesting that such national guidance has an effect.

The DNA-binding protein PRDM9 directs positioning of the double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination in mice and humans. In most mammals, the placement of genetic crossovers is determined by the binding of PRDM9, a highly polymorphic protein with a long zinc finger array, to its cognate binding sites.  the PRDM9 variant associated with hotspot activity binds specifically to DNA sequences located at the center of the three hotspots tested.   In many organisms, recombination occurs at limited sites, termed 'hotspots', whose positions in mammals are determined by PR domain member 9 (PRDM9), a long-array zinc-finger and chromatin-modifier protein. the binding specificities of PRDM9, and possibly other long-array zinc-finger proteins, are unusually complex. We also find that human PRDM9 frequently binds promoters, despite their low recombination rates, and it can activate expression of a small number of genes including CTCFL and VCX.

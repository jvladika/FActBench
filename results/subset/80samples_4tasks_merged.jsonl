{"input": "The role of the MCM2-7 helicase complex during Arabidopsis seed development. The MINICHROMOSOME MAINTENANCE 2-7 (MCM2-7) complex, a ring-shaped heterohexamer, unwinds the DNA double helix ahead of the other replication machinery.  MCM7 is one of the subunits of the MCM2-7 complex that plays a critical role in DNA replication initiation and cell proliferation of eukaryotic cells. After forming the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) with other components, the MCM2-7 complex is activated by DDK/cyclin-dependent kinase to initiate DNA replication.  Hexameric complexes of the six related Mcm2-7 proteins form the core of the replicative helicase.  MCM-BP regulates unloading of the MCM2-7 helicase in late S phase. Origins of DNA replication are licensed by recruiting MCM2-7 to assemble the prereplicative complex (pre-RC).  Mec1 is one of multiple kinases that prime the Mcm2-7 helicase for phosphorylation by Cdc7. Activation of the eukaryotic replicative DNA helicase, the Mcm2-7 complex, requires phosphorylation by Cdc7/Dbf4 (Dbf4-dependent kinase or DDK), which, in turn, depends on prior phosphorylation of Mcm2-7 by an unknown kinase (or kinases) The heterohexameric complex of minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCM2-7 complex) plays an essential role in origin licensing.  A double-hexameric MCM2-7 complex is loaded onto origin DNA during licensing of eukaryotic DNA replication. During pre-replication complex (pre-RC) formation, origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1 cooperatively load the 6-subunit mini chromosome maintenance (MCM2-7) complex onto DNA. Loading of MCM2-7 is a prerequisite for DNA licensing that restricts DNA replication to once per cell cycle. During S phase MCM2-7 functions as part of the replicative helicase but within the pre-RC MCM2-7 is inactive.  The quaternary structure of MCM2-7 changes during pre-RC formation: MCM2-7 before loading is a single hexamer in solution but is transformed into a double-hexamer during pre-RC formation. Using electron microscopy (EM), we observed that loaded MCM2-7 encircles DNA. The loaded MCM2-7 complex can slide on DNA, and sliding is not directional. Our results provide key insights into mechanisms of pre-RC formation and have important implications for understanding the role of the MCM2-7 in establishment of bidirectional replication forks. Cdt1 is required for loading the replicative DNA helicase MCM2/7, a process known as DNA replication licensing. Both the Mcm4/6/7 and Mcm2~7 complexes stimulate RNA primer synthesis by DNA primase in vitro. MCM7 is one of the subunits of the MCM2-7 complex that plays a critical role in DNA replication initiation and cell proliferation of eukaryotic cells These biochemical data suggest that phosphorylation of MCM4 at these sites by CDK plays a direct role in dislodging MCM2-7 from chromatin and/or preventing re-loading of the complex to chromatin The heterohexameric complex of minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCM2-7 complex) plays an essential role in origin licensing In this report, we have used bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays in HeLa cells to examine the interactions between Cdc45, Mcm2-7, and the GINS complex (collectively called the CMG complex), which seem to play a key role in the formation and progression of replication forks The origin recognition complex (ORC) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae binds origin DNA and cooperates with Cdc6 and Cdt1 to load the replicative helicase MCM2-7 onto DNA The CMG (Cdc45\u00b7Mcm2-7\u00b7GINS) complex, which is composed of Cdc45, Mcm2-7, and the GINS (Go-Ichi-Ni-San) complex consisting of Sld5 and Psf1 to Psf3, is recruited by Cdc6 and Cdt1 onto origins bound by the heterohexameric origin recognition complex (ORC) and functions as a replicative helicase MCM7 is one of the subunits of the MCM2-7 complex that plays a critical role in DNA replication initiation and cell proliferation of eukaryotic cells. The MCM2-7 complex, which may act as a replicative helicase during DNA synthesis, plays a central role in S-phase genome stability. The heterohexameric complex of minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCM2-7 complex) plays an essential role in origin licensing. In this work, we demonstrate that subunits of the MCM2-7 complex are coordinately expressed during Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) development and are abundant in proliferating and endocycling tissues, indicative of a role in DNA replication. Cdc6 and Cdt1 play an essential role in DNA replication initiation by loading the Mcm2-7 complex, which is required for unwinding the DNA helix, onto chromosomal origins. Inspired by the role of the rigid region in promoters, we speculate that the rigid replication origins may facilitate binding of proteins, including the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, Cdt1 and the MCM2-7 complex. Overall, our data identify a new Mcm protein, which does not form part of the Mcm2-7 complex and which is only structure-bound during S phase, thus suggesting its specific role in DNA replication. Using Mcm4/6/7 as a tool, we reveal a role for nucleotide binding by Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mcm2 in modulating DNA binding by Mcm complexes. The ORC/Cdc6/MCM2-7 complex facilitates MCM2-7 dimerization during prereplicative complex formation. Here, structural evidence for intermediates consisting of an ORC-Cdc6-Mcm2-7 complex and an ORC-Cdc6-Mcm2-7-Mcm2-7 complex are reported, which together provide new insights into DNA licensing. Our results provide key insights into mechanisms of pre-RC formation and have important implications for understanding the role of the MCM2-7 in establishment of bidirectional replication forks.. The Mcm proteins are a family of six homologous proteins (Mcm2-7) that play an important role in DNA replication.

{"input": "De Novo SOX6 Variants Cause a Neurodevelopmental Syndrome Associated with ADHD, Craniosynostosis, and Osteochondromas. For SOX6, these processes include, but are not limited to, neurogenesis and skeletogenesis. Variants in half of the SOX genes have been shown to cause severe developmental and adult syndromes, referred to as SOXopathies. We here provide evidence that SOX6 variants also cause a SOXopathy. Using clinical and genetic data, we identify 19 individuals harboring various types of SOX6 alterations and exhibiting developmental delay and/or intellectual disability; the individuals are from 17 unrelated families. Additional, inconstant features include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, mild facial dysmorphism, craniosynostosis, and multiple osteochondromas. All variants are heterozygous. Fourteen are de novo, one is inherited from a mosaic father, and four offspring from two families have a paternally inherited variant. Intragenic microdeletions, balanced structural rearrangements, frameshifts, and nonsense variants are predicted to inactivate the SOX6 variant allele. Four missense variants occur in residues and protein regions highly conserved evolutionarily. These variants are not detected in the gnomAD control cohort, and the amino acid substitutions are predicted to be damaging. Two of these variants are located in the HMG domain and abolish SOX6 transcriptional activity in\u00a0vitro. No clear genotype-phenotype correlations are found. Taken together, these findings concur that SOX6 haploinsufficiency leads to a neurodevelopmental SOXopathy that often includes ADHD and abnormal skeletal and other features.

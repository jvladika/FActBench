{"input": "The role of the MCM2-7 helicase complex during Arabidopsis seed development. The MINICHROMOSOME MAINTENANCE 2-7 (MCM2-7) complex, a ring-shaped heterohexamer, unwinds the DNA double helix ahead of the other replication machinery.  MCM7 is one of the subunits of the MCM2-7 complex that plays a critical role in DNA replication initiation and cell proliferation of eukaryotic cells. After forming the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) with other components, the MCM2-7 complex is activated by DDK/cyclin-dependent kinase to initiate DNA replication.  Hexameric complexes of the six related Mcm2-7 proteins form the core of the replicative helicase.  MCM-BP regulates unloading of the MCM2-7 helicase in late S phase. Origins of DNA replication are licensed by recruiting MCM2-7 to assemble the prereplicative complex (pre-RC).  Mec1 is one of multiple kinases that prime the Mcm2-7 helicase for phosphorylation by Cdc7. Activation of the eukaryotic replicative DNA helicase, the Mcm2-7 complex, requires phosphorylation by Cdc7/Dbf4 (Dbf4-dependent kinase or DDK), which, in turn, depends on prior phosphorylation of Mcm2-7 by an unknown kinase (or kinases) The heterohexameric complex of minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCM2-7 complex) plays an essential role in origin licensing.  A double-hexameric MCM2-7 complex is loaded onto origin DNA during licensing of eukaryotic DNA replication. During pre-replication complex (pre-RC) formation, origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1 cooperatively load the 6-subunit mini chromosome maintenance (MCM2-7) complex onto DNA. Loading of MCM2-7 is a prerequisite for DNA licensing that restricts DNA replication to once per cell cycle. During S phase MCM2-7 functions as part of the replicative helicase but within the pre-RC MCM2-7 is inactive.  The quaternary structure of MCM2-7 changes during pre-RC formation: MCM2-7 before loading is a single hexamer in solution but is transformed into a double-hexamer during pre-RC formation. Using electron microscopy (EM), we observed that loaded MCM2-7 encircles DNA. The loaded MCM2-7 complex can slide on DNA, and sliding is not directional. Our results provide key insights into mechanisms of pre-RC formation and have important implications for understanding the role of the MCM2-7 in establishment of bidirectional replication forks. Cdt1 is required for loading the replicative DNA helicase MCM2/7, a process known as DNA replication licensing. Both the Mcm4/6/7 and Mcm2~7 complexes stimulate RNA primer synthesis by DNA primase in vitro. MCM7 is one of the subunits of the MCM2-7 complex that plays a critical role in DNA replication initiation and cell proliferation of eukaryotic cells These biochemical data suggest that phosphorylation of MCM4 at these sites by CDK plays a direct role in dislodging MCM2-7 from chromatin and/or preventing re-loading of the complex to chromatin The heterohexameric complex of minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCM2-7 complex) plays an essential role in origin licensing In this report, we have used bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays in HeLa cells to examine the interactions between Cdc45, Mcm2-7, and the GINS complex (collectively called the CMG complex), which seem to play a key role in the formation and progression of replication forks The origin recognition complex (ORC) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae binds origin DNA and cooperates with Cdc6 and Cdt1 to load the replicative helicase MCM2-7 onto DNA The CMG (Cdc45\u00b7Mcm2-7\u00b7GINS) complex, which is composed of Cdc45, Mcm2-7, and the GINS (Go-Ichi-Ni-San) complex consisting of Sld5 and Psf1 to Psf3, is recruited by Cdc6 and Cdt1 onto origins bound by the heterohexameric origin recognition complex (ORC) and functions as a replicative helicase MCM7 is one of the subunits of the MCM2-7 complex that plays a critical role in DNA replication initiation and cell proliferation of eukaryotic cells. The MCM2-7 complex, which may act as a replicative helicase during DNA synthesis, plays a central role in S-phase genome stability. The heterohexameric complex of minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCM2-7 complex) plays an essential role in origin licensing. In this work, we demonstrate that subunits of the MCM2-7 complex are coordinately expressed during Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) development and are abundant in proliferating and endocycling tissues, indicative of a role in DNA replication. Cdc6 and Cdt1 play an essential role in DNA replication initiation by loading the Mcm2-7 complex, which is required for unwinding the DNA helix, onto chromosomal origins. Inspired by the role of the rigid region in promoters, we speculate that the rigid replication origins may facilitate binding of proteins, including the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, Cdt1 and the MCM2-7 complex. Overall, our data identify a new Mcm protein, which does not form part of the Mcm2-7 complex and which is only structure-bound during S phase, thus suggesting its specific role in DNA replication. Using Mcm4/6/7 as a tool, we reveal a role for nucleotide binding by Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mcm2 in modulating DNA binding by Mcm complexes. The ORC/Cdc6/MCM2-7 complex facilitates MCM2-7 dimerization during prereplicative complex formation. Here, structural evidence for intermediates consisting of an ORC-Cdc6-Mcm2-7 complex and an ORC-Cdc6-Mcm2-7-Mcm2-7 complex are reported, which together provide new insights into DNA licensing. Our results provide key insights into mechanisms of pre-RC formation and have important implications for understanding the role of the MCM2-7 in establishment of bidirectional replication forks..

{"input": "5-Methylcytosine (5 mC) in genomic DNA has important epigenetic functions in embryonic development and tumor biology. The modification of DNA by 5-methylcytosine (5mC) has essential roles in cell differentiation and development through epigenetic gene regulation. Notably, the balance between 5hmC and 5mC in the genome is linked with cell-differentiation processes such as pluripotency and lineage commitment. This Tet1-mediated antagonism of CpG methylation imparts differential maintenance of DNA methylation status at Tet1 targets, ultimately contributing to mESC differentiation and the onset of embryonic development. Tet1 and Tet2 catalyzed conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in Foxp3 to establish a Treg-cell-specific hypomethylation pattern and stable Foxp3 expression Consequently, Tet1 and Tet2 deletion led to Foxp3 hypermethylation, impaired Treg cell differentiation and function, and autoimmune disease. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), converted from 5-methylcytocine (5mC) by Tet family of dioxygenases (Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3), is enriched in the embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and in the brain We found that Tet3 expression is basically undetectable in ESCs, but its level increases rapidly during neuronal differentiation. 5mC oxidation by Tet2 modulates enhancer activity and timing of transcriptome reprogramming during differentiation Recent experiments have demonstrated that enhancers are enriched for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), an oxidization product of the Tet family of 5mC dioxygenases and an intermediate of DNA demethylation. By mapping DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation at base resolution, we find that deletion of Tet2 causes extensive loss of 5hmC at enhancers, accompanied by enhancer hypermethylation, reduction of enhancer activity, and delayed gene induction in the early steps of differentiation Loss of Tet enzymes compromises proper differentiation of embryonic stem cells These findings suggest a requirement for Tet- and 5hmC-mediated DNA demethylation in proper regulation of gene expression during ESC differentiation and development. We show that 5hmC is enriched in the gene body of highly expressed genes at all developmental stages and that its presence correlates positively with gene expression. Dynamic hydroxymethylation of deoxyribonucleic acid marks differentiation-associated enhancers In this study, we show by genome-wide mapping that the newly discovered deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is dynamically associated with transcription factor binding to distal regulatory sites during neural differentiation of mouse P19 cells and during adipocyte differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1 cells Hence, acquisition of 5hmC in cell-specific distal regulatory regions may represent a major event of enhancer progression toward an active state and participate in selective activation of tissue-specific genes. We find that 5hmC is mostly associated with euchromatin and that whereas 5mC is under-represented at gene promoters and CpG islands, 5hmC is enriched and is associated with increased transcriptional levels Knockdown of Tet1 and Tet2 causes downregulation of a group of genes that includes pluripotency-related genes (including Esrrb, Prdm14, Dppa3, Klf2, Tcl1 and Zfp42) and a concomitant increase in methylation of their promoters, together with an increased propensity of ES cells for extraembryonic lineage differentiation  Tet2 deficiency led to decreased genomic levels of 5hmC and augmented the size of the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell pool in a cell-autonomous manner. In competitive transplantation assays, Tet2-deficient HSCs were capable of multilineage reconstitution and possessed a competitive advantage over wild-type HSCs, resulting in enhanced hematopoiesis into both lymphoid and myeloid lineages. However, the role of 5hmC and Tet family in the process of ESC differentiation especially neuronal differentiation remains elusive Our data constitute a valuable resource that will facilitate detailed analysis of the role of 5hmC in T-cell development and differentiation More recently, a possible role of 5hmC as an epigenetic modifier and/or transcriptional regulator has started to emerge, with altered levels in early embryonic development, embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation and tumours (Tahiliani et al, 2009; Yang et al, 2012).  Here we report a method that combines TET-assisted bisulfite conversion with Illumina 450K DNA methylation arrays for a low-cost high-throughput approach that distinguishes 5hmC and 5mC signals at base resolution. Implementing this approach, termed \"TAB-array\", we assessed DNA methylation dynamics in the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into cardiovascular progenitors and neural precursor cells. With the ability to discriminate 5mC and 5hmC, we identified a large number of novel dynamically methylated genomic regions that are implicated in the development of these lineages.  5-hydroxy methyl cytosine (5hmC) is a modification identified in vertebrates several decades ago. More recently, a possible role of 5hmC as an epigenetic modifier and/or transcriptional regulator has started to emerge, with altered levels in early embryonic development, embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation and tumours (Tahiliani et al, 2009; Yang et al, 2012).

{"input": "Lysine methylation of histones is associated with both transcriptionally active chromatin and with silent chromatin, depending on what residue is modified. Histone methyltransferases and demethylases ensure that histone methylations are dynamic and can vary depending on cell cycle- or developmental stage. This approach identified Txr1p as a histone methyltransferase in Tetrahymena thermophila and characterized the relationships of the Txr1p and Ezl2p methyltransferases to histone H3 modification. Histone methyltransferases catalyze site-specific deposition of methyl groups, enabling recruitment of transcriptional regulators. In mammals, trimethylation of lysine 4 in histone H3, a modification localized at the transcription start sites of active genes, is catalyzed by six enzymes (SET1a and SET1b, MLL1-MLL4) whose specific functions are largely unknown.  Epigenetic regulation of gene expression by covalent modification of histones is important for germ line cell development. In mammals, histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)-specific histone methyltransferases (HMTases), such as G9a, SETDB1, and SUV39H, play critical roles, but the contribution of H3K9-specific HMTases in Drosophila remains to be clarified, especially in male sperm. By analyzing the distribution of histone modifications in nuclei using quantitative fluorescence microscopy, we found that H4K16 acetylation (H4K16ac) is underrepresented and H4K20 monomethylation (H4K20me1) is enriched on hermaphrodite X chromosomes in a DCC-dependent manner.   Here, we found the epigenetic modification of the BZLF1 promoter in latent Raji cells by histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), H3K9me2/me3, and H4K20me3.  Although DNA methyltransferases have been shown to interact with histone methyltransferases such as EZH2 (which methylates histone H3 on lysine 27) and G9a (which methylates histone H3 on lysine 9), the relationship between DNA methylation and repressive histone marks has not been fully studied.  Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique contribution.  Histone H3-lysine (K) 4, H3-K9 and H3-K27 modifications in all these four genes were examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay in HCC cell lines.  The histone H4 N-terminal tail has long been regarded as a major regulator in chromatin structure and function. Gene transcription is critically influenced by chromatin structure and the modification status of histone tails. Methylation of lysine residues in histone tails is dynamically regulated by the opposing activities of histone methyltransferases and histone demethylases. The SAS3-dependent NuA3 histone acetyltransferase complex was originally identified on the basis of its ability to acetylate histone H3 in vitro. SU(VAR)3-9 like histone methyltransferases control heterochromatic domains in eukaryotes. Methylation of position-specific lysine residues in histone N termini is a central modification for regulating epigenetic transitions in chromatin. Each methylatable lysine residue can exist in a mono-, di-, or trimethylated state, thereby extending the indexing potential of this particular modification.  One of these modifications, histone lysine methylation, has been shown to be highly stable and to represent an epigenetic alteration. Primarily because of the recent discovery of the SET domain-depending H3-specific histone methyltransferases SUV39H1 and Suv39h1, which selectively methylate lysine 9 of the H3 N terminus, this posttranslational modification has regained scientific interest. Set9, a novel histone H3 methyltransferase that facilitates transcription by precluding histone tail modifications required for heterochromatin formation. Our results suggest that the methylation of histone tails can have distinct effects on transcription, depending on its chromosomal location, the combination of posttranslational modifications, and the enzyme (or protein complex) involved in the particular modification. Among the different groups of enzymes known to catalyze the covalent modification, the most recent additions are the histone methyltransferases (HMTases), whose functions are now being characterized.

One approach that can facilitate a targeted assessment of candidate proteins, as well as proteins that are low in abundance or proteomically challenging, is by electrophoretic mobility shift assays.

However, the applicability of this method has been impaired by the difficulty of cleanly modifying protein thiols by large PEG reagents.

Both methods confirmed that AIRE and RASSF1A were hypomethylated in maternal blood cells but hypermethylated in placental or chorionic villus tissues. It was concluded that hypermethylated AIRE and RASSF1A may serve as fetal-specific markers for the identification of fetal DNA in maternal plasma and may be used for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21. Preliminary reports indicate that the detection of fetal aneuploidies might be possible using epigenetically modified genes, e.g. maspin on chromosome 18. Additionally, an exiting recent development is that it might be feasible to detect Down syndrome via the quantitative assessment of placentally derived cell-free mRNA of chromosome-21-specific genes such as PLAC4 Candidate epigenetic biomarkers for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome Next, it was shown that the methylation status of chorionic villus sample DNA from first trimester pregnancies matched the hypermethylated state of term placenta.

{"input": "Furthermore, using specific inhibitors of the TH-activated kinases, we show that the long-term effects of TH on the expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), alpha- and beta-myosin heavy chain (MHC) and cell growth are reverted, implying that what is initiated as a non-genomic action of the hormone interfaces with genomic effects. Hypothyroid neonates showed increased cholesterol levels and decreased expression of D1 in liver and of Serca-2 in heart, which were normalized with T3 treatment. ERCA2 transcript and protein levels were reduced in FOG-2 transgenic hearts, and FOG-2 overexpression impaired T3-mediated SERCA2 expression in cultured cardiomyocytes. FOG-2 physically interacts with thyroid hormone receptor-alpha1 and abrogated even high levels of T3-mediated SERCA2 promoter activity. A marked elevation of the expression of beta-MHC and a reduced ratio of SERCA/Phospholamban were found in viable myocardium of AMI hearts, which was prevented by TH After TH treatment, AMI-THYR hearts expressed 71% alpha-MHC and 29% beta-MHC, P<0.05 versus SHAM and AMI and the ratio of SERCA/PLB was increased by 2.0-fold, P<0.05 versus SHAM and AMI. Because the binding of T(3) occupied receptors to the thyroid response elements in the SERCA promotor can increase gene expression These results demonstrate that increasing TR expression in the hypertrophied heart is associated with an improvement in contractile function and increased SERCA expression. Increased cardiac D2 activity led to elevated cardiac T3 levels and to enhanced myocardial contractility, accompanied by increased Ca(2+) transients and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) uptake. These phenotypic changes were associated with up-regulation of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) 2a expression Our results establish that elevated D2 activity in the heart increases T3 levels and enhances cardiac contractile function while preventing deterioration of cardiac function Hypothyroid heart displays a phenotype of cardioprotection against ischemia and this study investigated whether administration of dronedarone, an amiodarone-like compound that has been shown to preferentially antagonize thyroid hormone binding to thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TRalpha1), results in a similar effect. Dronedarone was given in Wistar rats (90 mg/kg, once daily (od) for 2 weeks) (DRON), while untreated animals served as controls (CONT). Hypothyroidism (HYPO) was induced by propylthiouracil administration. while beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) expression (SERCA) was similar to CONT. In HYPO, alpha-MHC and SERCA were decreased while beta-MHC was increased. the postnatal switch from beta- to alpha-myosin heavy chain (beta- and alpha-MHC, respectively) gene expression and the increase of SERCA-2a mRNA expression did not occur in the ventricular myocardium of either the transgenic (thyroid destroyed) or nontransgenic (intact thyroid) offspring of hypothyroid mothers In addition, TR cotransfection and treatment with the TRbeta1-selective agonist GC-1 suggested different functional coupling of the TR isoforms, TRbeta1 to transcription of beta-MyHC, SERCA, and TRbeta1, dditionally, in T3-deprived samples alpha-sarcomeric actinin and SERCA-2 protein levels were reduced to 65.6 +/- 3% (P < 0.0001) and 74.1 +/- 4% (P=0.005), respectively, when compared with the T3-supplemented group. even mild chronic myocardial thyrotoxicosis, such as may occur in human hyperthyroidism, can cause tachycardia and associated changes in high energy phosphate compounds independent of an increase in SERCA II and alpha-MHC. Myocytes from banded hearts treated with T4 were hypertrophied but had increased concentrations of alpha-MHC and SERCA proteins Thyroid hormone (T3) increases the transcription of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) gene (SERCA 2) through three thyroid hormone response elements. MEF-2a in combination with either T3R alpha 1 or T3R beta 1 isoforms resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in SERCA 2 transgene expression in the absence of T3. Addition of T3 did not induce any further increase in SERCA 2 expression when T3R alpha 1 and MEF-2a expression vectors were cotransfected. In contrast, in the presence of T3R beta 1 and MEF-2, the addition of T3 increased chlorampenicol acetyltransferase activity by an additional 2.2-fold to a total 5.5-fold increase. Our findings point to T3R isoform-specific interactions with a cell type-specific transcription factor (MEF-2) in the regulation of SERCA 2 gene expression. These data are consistent with pretranslational and possibly transcriptional level effect of thyroid hormone on the cardiac SR Ca2+ pump gene (SERCA 2) These data demonstrate that T3 increases expression of the cardiac SR Ca2+ pump, that the effect can be localized to the cardiomyocyte, and that the effect is dependent on thyroid hormone receptors. Thyroid hormone receptor (TR), a transcriptional activator, affected the regulation of gene expression of MHC and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase. The thyroid hormone responsiveness of SR Ca2(+)-ATPase mRNA has been previously established. The mRNA encoding the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ ATPase is highly influenced by thyroid hormone (T3) in the hearts of intact animals. Direct cellular effects of thyroid hormone have been implicated in modulating the expression of the myosin heavy chain (MHC) genes and the slow sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium adenosine triphosphatase (SR Ca(2+)-ATPase) gene.

Absence or severe deficiency of this enzyme can lead to bilirubin accumulation in the body resulting in yellow skin and eyes (jaundice).   jaundice refers to yellow coloration of the skin and the sclera (whites of the eyes) of newborn babies that result from the accumulation of bilirubin in the skin and mucous membranes. however, are hindered by the relatively limited knowledge about the impact of different amounts of extravascular bilirubin on skin spectral responses and on the onset of jaundice, the resulting yellow-tinted skin appearance.  Febrile jaundice results clinically in generalized yellow coloration of the teguments and mucous membranes due to excess plasma bilirubin, accompanied by fever.  Jaundice is a yellowish pigmentation of skin and mucous membranes caused by hyperbilirubinemia, which itself has various causes.  signs of jaundice occur when the serum bilirubin level exceeds 2.5 to 3 mg/dL.

Jaundice is a clinical manifestation of disorders of underlying bilirubin metabolism, hepatocellular dysfunction, or biliary obstruction. Clinical signs of jaundice occur when the serum bilirubin level exceeds 2.5 to 3 mg/ Prehepatic causes of jaundice include hemolysis and hematoma resorption, which lead to elevated levels of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. The most common causes of jaundice were drug-induced hepatitis, occurring in 11 patients (31 percent), and alcoholic liver disease, occurring in 5 (13 percent). Jaundice is one of the notable markers of liver malfunction in our body, revealing a significant rise in the concentration of an endogenous yellow pigment bilirubin. Clinical signs of jaundice occur when the serum bilirubin level exceeds 2.5 to 3 mg/dL.

Due to high volatility and environmental mobility, radioactive isotopes of iodine pose a serious risk in the acute phases of a nuclear accident. The critical organ for iodine is the thyroid.

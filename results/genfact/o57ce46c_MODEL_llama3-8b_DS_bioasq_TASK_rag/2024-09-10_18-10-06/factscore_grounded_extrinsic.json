Evidence from a meta-analysis demonstrated significant reductions in all-cause mortality with beta-blocker therapy, though overall effects were driven largely by small, older trials of patients post-myocardial infarction. Some evidence suggests that vasodilating beta blockers, such as nebivolol, can provide a benefit for patients with heart failure regardless of ejection fraction. Additionally, because of the chronotropic perturbation and diminished LV filling seen in HFpEF the bradycardic effect of beta blockers may enable improved filling, reduce myocardial oxygen demand, and lower blood pressure. However, this effect also can contribute to diminished response to exercise demands and can result in an excessive reduction in heart rate.

Specifically, cardiac resynchronization, administration of beta blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are applied to good effect in HFrEF but are largely ineffective at reducing morbidity and mortality in HFpEF. Many of these therapies are effective in reducing the extent of cardiac dilation and increasing ejection fraction in HFrEF patients. It is unsurprising they fail to effect improvement in HFpEF patients, given their un-dilated phenotype and relative normal ejection fraction. Understanding and targeting mechanisms unique to HFpEF are thus essential to the development of therapeutics. Randomized studies on HFpEF patients have shown that exercise improves left ventricular diastolic function, the heart's ability to relax, and is associated with improved aerobic exercise capacity. The benefit patients seem to derive from exercise does not seem to be a direct cardiac effect, but rather is due to changes in peripheral vasculature and skeletal muscle, which show abnormalities in HFpEF patients.

ACE inhibitors inhibit the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme, an important component of the renin\u2013angiotensin system which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, and hydrolyses bradykinin. Therefore, ACE inhibitors decrease the formation of angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictor, and increase the level of bradykinin, a peptide vasodilator. This combination is synergistic in lowering blood pressure. As a result of inhibiting the ACE enzyme in the bradykinin system, the ACE inhibitor drugs allow for increased levels of bradykinin which would normally be degraded.

The spliceosome is assembled from small nuclear RNAs (snRNA) and numerous proteins. Small nuclear RNA (snRNA) molecules bind to specific proteins to form a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex (snRNP, pronounced \u201csnurps\u201d), which in turn combines with other snRNPs to form a large ribonucleoprotein complex called a spliceosome. The spliceosome removes introns from a transcribed pre-mRNA, a type of primary transcript. This process is generally referred to as splicing. An analogy is a film editor, who selectively cuts out irrelevant or incorrect material (equivalent to the introns) from the initial film and sends the cleaned-up version to the director for the final cut. However, sometimes the RNA within the intron acts as a ribozyme, splicing itself without the use of a spliceosome or protein enzymes.History.

The model for formation of the spliceosome active site involves an ordered, stepwise assembly of discrete snRNP particles on the pre-mRNA substrate. The first recognition of pre-mRNAs involves U1 snRNP binding to the 5' end splice site of the pre-mRNA and other non-snRNP associated factors to form the commitment complex, or early (E) complex in mammals. The commitment complex is an ATP-independent complex that commits the pre-mRNA to the splicing pathway. U2 snRNP is recruited to the branch region through interactions with the E complex component U2AF (U2 snRNP auxiliary factor) and possibly U1 snRNP.

It is characterized by the degenerative loss of skeletal muscle mass, quality, and strength. The rate of muscle loss is dependent on exercise level, co-morbidities, nutrition and other factors. The muscle loss is related to changes in muscle synthesis signalling pathways. It is distinct from cachexia, in which muscle is degraded through cytokine-mediated degradation, although both conditions may co-exist. Sarcopenia is considered a component of frailty syndrome. Sarcopenia can lead to reduced quality of life, falls, fracture, and disability. Sarcopenia is a factor in changing body composition associated with aging populations; and certain muscle regions are expected to be affected first, specifically the anterior thigh and abdominal muscles. In population studies, body mass index (BMI) is seen to decrease in aging populations while bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) shows body fat proportion rising.{{cite journal The term sarcopenia is from Greek \u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03be \"sarx\", \"flesh\" and \u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 \"penia\", \"poverty\n\nTitle: Sarcopenia\nText:  is at least two standard deviations below the relevant population mean and has a slow walking speed. The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) developed a broad clinical definition for sarcopenia, designated as the presence of low muscle mass and either low muscular strength or low physical performance. Other international groups have proposed criteria that include metrics on walking speed, distance walked in 6\u2009minutes, or grip strength. Hand grip strength alone has also been advocated as a clinical marker of sarcopenia that is simple and cost effective and has good predictive power, although it does not provide comprehensive information. There are screening tools for sarcopenia that assess patient reported difficulty in doing daily activities such as walking, climbing stairs or standing from a chair and have been shown to predict sarcopenia and poor functional outcomes.Management.Management.:Exercise. Exercise remains the intervention of choice for sarcopenia, but translation of research findings into clinical practice is challenging. The type, duration and intensity of exercise are variable between studies, preventing a standardized exercise prescription for sarcopenia. Lack of exercise is a significant risk factor for sarcopenia and exercise can dramatically slow the rate of muscle loss. Exercise can be an effective intervention because aging skeletal muscle\n\nTitle: Sarcopenia\nText:  retains ability to synthesize proteins in response to short-term resistance exercise. Progressive resistance training in older adults can improve physical performance (gait speed) and muscular strength.Management.:Medication. There are currently no approved medications for the treatment of sarcopenia. Testosterone or other anabolic steroids have also been investigated for treatment of sarcopenia, and seem to have some positive effects on muscle strength and mass, but cause several side effects and raise concerns of prostate cancer in men and virilization in women. Additionally, recent studies suggest testosterone treatments may induce adverse cardiovascular events. DHEA and human growth hormone have been shown to have little to no effect in this setting. Growth hormone increases muscle protein synthesis and increases muscle mass, but does not lead to gains in strength and function in most studies.

There are significant opportunities to better understand the causes and consequences of sarcopenia and help guide clinical care. This includes elucidation of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of sarcopenia, further refinement of reference populations by ethnic groups, validation of diagnostic criteria and clinical tools, as well as tracking of incidence of hospitalization admissions, morbidity, and mortality. Identification and research on potential therapeutic approaches and timing of interventions is also needed. New pharmaceutical therapies in clinical development include myostatin and the selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs). Nonsteriodal SARMs are of particular interest, given they exhibit significant selectivity between the anabolic effects of testosterone on muscle, but with little to no evidence of androgenic effects (such as prostate stimulation in men).See also. - Cachexia - Ageing - Frailty syndrome - Geriatrics - DynapeniaFurther reading. - - - Sharlo K, Tyganov SA, Tomilovskaya E, Popov DV, Saveko AA, Shenkman BS.

Similar to other -ome based technologies, analysis of the transcriptome allows for an unbiased approach when validating hypotheses experimentally. This approach also allows for the discovery of novel mediators in signaling pathways. As with other -omics based technologies, the transcriptome can be analyzed within the scope of a multiomics approach. It is complementary to metabolomics but contrary to proteomics, a direct association between a transcript and metabolite cannot be established. There are several -ome fields that can be seen as subcategories of the transcriptome. The exome differs from the transcriptome in that it includes only those RNA molecules found in a specified cell population, and usually includes the amount or concentration of each RNA molecule in addition to the molecular identities. Additionally, the transcritpome also differs from the translatome, which is the set of RNAs undergoing translation.

The number of non-protein-coding sequences increases in more complex organisms. Several factors render the content of the transcriptome difficult to establish. These include alternative splicing, RNA editing and alternative transcription among others. Additionally, transcriptome techniques are capable of capturing transcription occurring in a sample at a specific time point, although the content of the transcriptome can change during differentiation. The main aims of transcriptomics are the following: \"catalogue all species of transcript, including mRNAs, non-coding RNAs and small RNAs; to determine the transcriptional structure of genes, in terms of their start sites, 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, splicing patterns and other post-transcriptional modifications; and to quantify the changing expression levels of each transcript during development and under different conditions\". The term can be applied to the total set of transcripts in a given organism, or to the specific subset of transcripts present in a particular cell type. Unlike the genome, which is roughly fixed for a given cell line (excluding mutations), the transcriptome can vary with external environmental conditions. Because it includes all mRNA transcripts in the cell, the transcriptome reflects the genes that are being actively expressed at any given time\n\nTitle: Transcriptome\nText: Transcriptome The transcriptome is the set of all RNA transcripts, including coding and non-coding, in an individual or a population of cells. The term can also sometimes be used to refer to all RNAs, or just mRNA, depending on the particular experiment. The term \"transcriptome\" is a portmanteau of the words \"transcript\" and \"genome\"; it is associated with the process of transcript production during the biological process of transcription. The early stages of transcriptome annotations began with cDNA libraries published in the 1980s. Subsequently, the advent of high-throughput technology led to faster and more efficient ways of obtaining data about the transcriptome. Two biological techniques are used to study the transcriptome, namely DNA microarray, a hybridization-based technique and RNA-seq, a sequence-based approach. RNA-seq is the preferred method and has been the dominant transcriptomics technique since the 2010s. Single-cell transcriptomics allows tracking of transcript changes over time within individual cells. Data obtained from the transcriptome is used in research to gain insight into processes such as cellular differentiation, carcinogenesis, transcription regulation and biomarker discovery among others.

Erythropoietin has been shown to exert its effects by binding to the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR).

This results in differentiation, survival and proliferation of the erythroid cell. SOCS1, SOCS3 and CIS are also expressed which act as negative regulators of the cytokine signal. High level erythropoietin receptor expression is localized to erythroid progenitor cells. While there are reports that EPO receptors are found in a number of other tissues, such as heart, muscle, kidney and peripheral/central nervous tissue, those results are confounded by nonspecificity of reagents such as anti-EpoR antibodies.

This substance was purified and confirmed as erythropoietin. In 1977, Goldwasser and Kung purified EPO. Pure EPO allowed the amino acid sequence to be partially identified and the gene to be isolated. Synthetic EPO was first successfully used to correct anemia in 1987. In 1985, Lin \"et al\" isolated the human erythropoietin gene from a genomic phage library and used it to produce EPO. In 1989, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the hormone Epogen for use in certain anemias. Gregg L. Semenza and Peter J.

Low levels of EPO (around 10\u00a0mU/mL) are constantly secreted in sufficient quantities to compensate for normal red blood cell turnover. Common causes of cellular hypoxia resulting in elevated levels of EPO (up to 10\u00a0000\u00a0mU/mL) include any anemia, and hypoxemia due to chronic lung disease. Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney in close association with the peritubular capillary and proximal convoluted tubule. It is also produced in perisinusoidal cells in the liver. Liver production predominates in the fetal and perinatal period; renal production predominates in adulthood.

One aspect of the Molecular function is the Paraspeckle's ability to sequester other molecules affecting transcription. This is done by both NEAT1 and some constituent proteins. NEAT1 is primarily responsible for the Paraspeckle's architecture and providing stability to the protein components. Yet, it has also been shown to regulate gene expression. This is done by recruiting transcription factors, sequestering them from gene promoters and ultimately altering transcription. Furthermore, Wang, Z, Li K, Huang, W (2019) state that NEAT1 can regulate expression by associating with RNA-binding proteins this regulates RNA splicing events and can manipulate the stability of proteins. Another form of molecule sequestering is through NONO and SFPQ, both proteins can bind to double-stranded RNA that has formed as a result of transcribed inverted repeat motifs.

(2014), when NEAT1_2 levels increase, Paraspeckles elongate.

This reduces nucleoplasmic protein availability. It was noted in their study that this has an impact on the role of free Paraspeckle proteins such as SFPQ which normally represses IL-8, an immune-responsive gene, or can activate the ADARB2 gene. Thus, gene regulation can be manipulated not just through sequestering of non-constituent proteins but also Paraspeckle constitutive proteins.\n\nTitle: Paraspeckle\nText: Paraspeckle In cell biology, a paraspeckle is an irregularly shaped compartment of the cell, approximately 0.2-1 \u03bcm in size, found in the nucleus' interchromatin space.

It is found in larger amounts than in healthy cells in a wide range of cancers including breast, prostate, bladder, uterine, and renal cancers, as well as melanoma and lymphoma. EZH2 is a gene suppressor, so when it becomes overexpressed, many tumor suppressor genes that are normally turned on, are turned off. Inhibition of EZH2 function shrinks malignant tumors in some reported cases because those tumor suppressor genes are not silenced by EZH2.

Because of this characteristic, overexpression of EZH2 can be used\n\nTitle: EZH2\nText:  in the control of mammalian gene expression and have a functional role in heterochromatin formation, X-chromosome inactivation and transcriptional regulation. In mammalian chromosomes, histone lysine methylation can either activate or repress genes depending the site of methylation. Recent work has shown that at least part of the silencing function of the EZH2 complex is the methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27. Methylation, and other modifications, take place on the histones. Methyl modifications can affect the binding of proteins to these histones and either activate or inhibit transcription.Enzymatic activity.:Mechanism of catalysis. EZH2 is a member of the SET domain family of lysine methyltransferases which function to add methyl groups to lysine side chains of substrate proteins. SET methyltransferases depend on a S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) cofactor to act as a methyl donor for their catalytic activity. SET domain proteins differ from other SAM-dependent methyltransferases in that they bind their substrate and SAM cofactor on opposite sides of the active site of the enzyme. This orientation of substrate and cofactor allows SAM to dissociate without disrupting substrate binding\n\nTitle: EZH2\nText: 3 in regions containing developmental genes appears to be important for maintenance of normal cell differentiation. H3K27me3 is also important in driving X-inactivation, the silencing of one X-chromosome in females during development. During X-inactivation, it is thought that EZH2 is involved in initiating heterochromatin formation by trimethylating H3K27 and that other histone methyltransferases and histone marks may be involved in maintaining the silenced state. Further, EZH2 has been identified as an essential protein involved in development and differentiation of B-cells and T-cells. H3K27me3 is involved in suppressing genes that promote differentiation, thus maintaining an undifferentiated state of B- and T-cells and playing an important role in regulating hematopoiesis.Function.:Regulation of EZH2 activity. The activity of EZH2 is regulated by the post-translational phosphorylation of threonine and serine residues on EZH2. Specifically, phosphorylation of T350 has been linked to an increase in EZH2 activity while phosphorylation of T492 and S21 have been linked to a decrease in EZH\n\nTitle: EZH2\nText: EZH2 Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase enzyme (EC 2.1.1.43) encoded by gene, that participates in histone methylation and, ultimately, transcriptional repression. EZH2 catalyzes the addition of methyl groups to histone H3 at lysine 27, by using the cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Methylation activity of EZH2 facilitates heterochromatin formation thereby silences gene function. Remodeling of chromosomal heterochromatin by EZH2 is also required during cell mitosis. EZH2 is the functional enzymatic component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which is responsible for healthy embryonic development through the epigenetic maintenance of genes responsible for regulating development and differentiation. EZH2 is responsible for the methylation activity of PRC2, and the complex also contains proteins required for optimal function (EED, SUZ12, JARID2, AEBP2, RbAp46/48, and PCL).

EZH2, as a part of PRC2, catalyzes trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3), which is a histone modification that has been characterized as part of the histone code. The histone code is the theory that chemical modifications, such as methylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, of histone proteins play distinctive roles in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. EZH2-mediated catalysis of H3K27me3 is associated with long term transcription repression. EZH2, as well as other Polycomb group proteins, are involved in establishing and maintaining gene repression through cell division. This transcriptionally repressive state is thought to be due to PRC2/EZH2-EED-mediated H3K27 methylation and subsequent recruitment of PRC1 which facilitates condensation of chromatin and formation of heterochromatin.

It also inhibits another metabolizing enzyme, cytochrome CYP2D6. For this reason, the doses of ranolazine and drugs that interact with those enzymes need to be adjusted when they are used by the same patient.

Ranolazine inhibits persistent or late inward sodium current (\"I\") in heart muscle in a variety of voltage-gated sodium channels. Inhibiting that current leads to reductions in intracellular calcium levels. This in turn leads to reduced tension in the heart wall, leading to reduced oxygen requirements for the muscle. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of \"I\", which prolongs the ventricular action potential. Ranolazine also exhibits its effects on the delayed rectifier current (hERG/\"I\" potassium channels), it readily stimulates myogenesis, it reduces a pro-oxidant inflammation/oxidative condition, and activates the calcium signaling pathway. Ranolazine prolongs the action potential duration, with corresponding QT interval prolongation on electrocardiography, blocks the \"I\" current, and prevents calcium\n\n"}], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [{"atom": "Prostaglandins promote fibrillar collagen formation.", "is_supported": false, "idx": 1, "wiki_context": "Title: Prostaglandin\nText:  ABCC4), a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily.

Prostaglandins have been found in almost every tissue in humans and other animals. They are derived enzymatically from the fatty acid arachidonic acid. Every prostaglandin contains 20 carbon atoms, including a 5-carbon ring. They are a subclass of eicosanoids and of the prostanoid class of fatty acid derivatives. The structural differences between prostaglandins account for their different biological activities. A given prostaglandin may have different and even opposite effects in different tissues in some cases. The ability of the same prostaglandin to stimulate a reaction in one tissue and inhibit the same reaction in another tissue is determined by the type of receptor to which the prostaglandin binds. They act as autocrine or paracrine factors with their target cells present in the immediate vicinity of the site of their secretion. Prostaglandins differ from endocrine hormones in that they are not produced at a specific site but in many places throughout the human body. Prostaglandins are powerful, locally-acting vasodilators\n\nTitle: Prostaglandin\nText:  and inhibit the aggregation of blood platelets. Through their role in vasodilation, prostaglandins are also involved in inflammation. They are synthesized in the walls of blood vessels and serve the physiological function of preventing needless clot formation, as well as regulating the contraction of smooth muscle tissue. Conversely, thromboxanes (produced by platelet cells) are vasoconstrictors and facilitate platelet aggregation. Their name comes from their role in clot formation (thrombosis). Specific prostaglandins are named with a letter (which indicates the type of ring structure) followed by a number (which indicates the number of double bonds in the hydrocarbon structure). For example, prostaglandin E1 is abbreviated PGE, and prostaglandin I2 is abbreviated PGI.History and name.

The pathogenesis of NCGS is not well understood, but the activation of the innate immune system, the direct cytotoxic effects of gluten and probably other wheat components, are implicated.

These methodological elements and organization of procedures tend to be more characteristic of experimental sciences than social sciences. Nonetheless, the cycle of formulating hypotheses, testing and analyzing the results, and formulating new hypotheses, will resemble the cycle described below. The scientific method is an iterative, cyclical process through which information is continually revised. It is generally recognized to develop advances in knowledge through the following elements, in varying combinations or contributions: - Characterizations (observations, definitions, and measurements of the subject of inquiry) - Hypotheses (theoretical, hypothetical explanations of observations and measurements of the subject) - Predictions (inductive and deductive reasoning from the hypothesis or theory) - Experiments (tests of all of the above) Each element of the scientific method\n\nTitle: Scientific method\nText: Scientific method The scientific method is an empirical method for acquiring knowledge that has characterized the development of science since at least the 17th century (with notable practitioners in previous centuries; see the article history of scientific method for additional detail.) It involves careful observation, applying rigorous skepticism about what is observed, given that cognitive assumptions can distort how one interprets the observation. It involves formulating hypotheses, via induction, based on such observations; the testability of hypotheses, experimental and the measurement-based statistical testing of deductions drawn from the hypotheses; and refinement (or elimination) of the hypotheses based on the experimental findings. These are \"principles\" of the scientific method, as distinguished from a definitive series of steps applicable to all scientific enterprises. Although procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another, the underlying process is frequently the same from one field to another. The process in the scientific method involves making conjectures (hypothetical explanations), deriving predictions from the hypotheses as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions.

There may be an appearance of \"arc-shaped loss of alveolar bone extending from the distal surface of the second premolar to the mesial surface of the second molar\". - In GAP, generalized bone destruction is present that ranges from mild crestal bone resorption to severe alveolar bone destruction, depending on the severity of the disease.

Therefore, the prevalence of LAP varies considerably between continents, and differences in race or ethnicity seem to be a major contributing factor. Aggressive periodontitis is much less common than chronic periodontitis and generally affects younger patients than does the chronic form. Around 1 in every 1000 patients experience more rapid loss of attachment. Males seem to be at higher risk of GAP than females The localized and generalized forms are not merely different in extent; they differ in etiology and pathogenesis.Etiology.Etiology.:Microbiology. Of the microflora characterised in aggressive periodontitis, approximately 65-75% of bacteria are Gram-negative bacilli, with few spirochaetes or motile rods present. Aggressive periodontitis is often characterised by a rapid loss of periodontal attachment associated with highly pathogenic bacteria and an impaired immune response. Various studies have associated \"Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans\", formerly known as \"Actinobacillus actinomycet\n\nTitle: Aggressive periodontitis\nText:  with aggressive periodontitis. - The severity of periodontal tissue destruction is out of proportion to amount of bacteria present. The amount of bacteria is often indicated by the level of dental plaque. This feature implies that when aggressive periodontitis is present, loss of attachment and bone loss tend to occur even if the plaque level is low. - High levels of Aggregatibacter (or Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans and, in some populations, Porphyromonas gingivalis. These gram-negative microbes are considered the chief aetiological agent of aggressive periodontitis. They are implicated in the development of aggressive periodontitis by triggering inflammatory response in periodontal tissue. - There are abnormalities associated with phagocytes. Phagocytes are essential in resolving inflammation. The impairment of their phagocytic activity results in persistent inflammation in periodontal tissues. - Hyper-responsive macrophage phenotype. Due to the increased responsiveness, the macrophages produce excessive levels of inflammatory mediator and cytokine, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1B). Their hyperactivity is associated with periodontal tissue destruction and\n\nTitle: Aggressive periodontitis\nText:  for both localized and generalized form of disease.Features.:Primary features. - Patients are clinically healthy. Patients do not have any underlying systemic disease that would contribute to aggressive periodontitis. For instance, diabetes is proved to be associated with periodontitis- it is a major risk factor when glycaemic control is poor. - The rate of loss of attachment and bone loss is rapid. Loss of attachment refers to the destruction of periodontium whereas the bone refers to the alveolar bone supporting the teeth. The loss can be determined by using a calibrated periodontal probe and taking radiographs of the dentition. Usually the loss of attachment is greater than 2mm per year. - Aggressive periodontitis runs in the patient's family. Familial aggregation of aggressive periodontitis is often discovered by taking a thorough medical history of the patient. The patient is said to have a high genetic susceptibility to aggressive periodontitis. Many studies have shown that genetic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease. In this case, the manifestation of aggressive periodontitis is believed to be the result of genetic mutation, combined with environmental factors.Features.:Secondary features. Secondary features are characteristics which are frequently seen but not always present in every patient diagnosed\n\nTitle: Aggressive periodontitis\nText:  bacterial and inflammatory stimuli with very high levels of local release inflammatory mediators and induce hyper-inflammatory reaction with activation of tissue degrading matrix-metalloproteinases. These is also evidence they produce increased amounts IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 which cause osteoclastic bone resorption. These amounts are greatly reduced following treatment. Studies of families, twins and sibling pairs have provided strong evidence for a genetic basis for aggressive periodontitis. A person's genetic predisposition to the condition is determined by a single gene of major effect, inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. However, for the disease process to initiate the person must be exposed to the presence of periodontal pathogens and potentially also various environmental factors. Smoking is a generalized risk factor for generalized forms of aggressive periodontitis. Studies found that smokers have more affected teeth than non-smokers and high levels of attachment loss. This is due to the suppression of serum IgG2 and antibody against \"Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans\" found in smokers.Features. According to the 1999 International Workshop for the Classification of Periodontal Diseases, aggressive periodontitis was defined according to 3 primary features, in contrast to chronic periodontitis. These features are common\n\n"}, {"atom": "The gene expression profiles of aggressive periodontitis are separate from those of chronic periodontitis.", "is_supported": true, "idx": 5, "wiki_context": "Title: HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer\nText:  oral infection precedes the development of HPV+OPC. Slight injuries in the mucous membrane serve as an entry gate for HPV, which thus works into the basal layer of the epithelium. People testing positive for HPV type 16 virus (HPV16) oral infection have a 14 times increased risk of developing HPV+OPC. Immunosuppression seems to be an increased risk factor for HPV+OPC. Individuals with TGF-\u03b21 genetic variations, specially T869C, are more likely to have HPV16+OPC. TGF-\u03b21 plays an important role in controlling the immune system. In 1993 it was noted that patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated anogenital cancers had a 4-fold increased risk of tonsillar squamous-cell carcinoma. Although evidence suggests that HPV16 is the main cause of OPC in humans not exposed to smoking and alcohol, the degree to which tobacco and/or alcohol use may contribute to increase the risk of HPV+OPC has not always been clear but it appears that both smoking and HPV infection are independent and additive risk factors for developing OPC.

HPV+OPC also differs from HPV-OPC in being focal rather than multifocal and not being associated with pre-malignant dysplasia. HPV+OPC patients are therefore at less risk of developing other malignancies in the head and neck region, unlike other head and neck primary tumours that may have associated second neoplasms, that may occur at the same time (synchronous) or a distant time (metachronous), both within the head and neck region or more distantly. This suggests that the oncogenic alterations produced by the virus are spatially limited rather than related to a field defect.Pathology.:Anatomy.

Like most HPV+ cancers, HPV+OPC express p16 but the latter does not function as a tumour-suppressor, because the mechanism by which this is achieved, pRb, has been inactivated by E7. p16 is upregulated (over-expressed) due to E7-related loss of pRB with reduced negative feedback, whereas it is downregulated in up to 90% of HPV-OPC. This diffuse over-expression in the tumour cells provides a diagnostic marker for HPV involvement. Although HPV E6 and E7 reduce tumour suppressor activity, they do so less than genetic and epigenetic processes do in HPV-OPC.

The configuration space of a protein during folding can be visualized as an energy landscape. According to Joseph Bryngelson and Peter Wolynes, proteins follow the \"principle of minimal frustration\", meaning that naturally evolved proteins have optimized their folding energy landscapes, and that nature has chosen amino acid sequences so that the folded state of the protein is sufficiently stable. In addition, the acquisition of the folded state had to become a sufficiently fast process. Even though nature has reduced the level of \"frustration\" in proteins, some degree of it remains up to now as can be observed in the presence of local minima in the energy landscape of proteins. A consequence of these evolutionarily selected sequences is that proteins are generally thought to have globally \"funneled energy landscapes\" (a term coined by Jos\u00e9 Onuchic) that are largely directed toward the native state. This \"folding funnel\" landscape allows the protein to fold to the native state through any of a large number of pathways and intermediates,\n\nTitle: Protein folding\nText: Protein folding Protein folding is the physical process by which a protein chain is translated into its native three-dimensional structure, typically a \"folded\" conformation, by which the protein becomes biologically functional. Via an expeditious and reproducible process, a polypeptide folds into its characteristic three-dimensional structure from a random coil. Each protein exists first as an unfolded polypeptide or random coil after being translated from a sequence of mRNA into a linear chain of amino acids. At this stage, the polypeptide lacks any stable (i.e., long-lasting) three-dimensional structure (see the left side of the first figure). As the polypeptide chain is being synthesized by a ribosome, the linear chain begins to fold into its three-dimensional structure. The folding of many proteins begins even during the translation of the polypeptide chain. The amino acids interact with each other to produce a well-defined three-dimensional structure, the folded protein (see the right side of the figure), known as the native state. The resulting three-dimensional structure is determined by the amino-acid sequence or primary structure (e.g., Anfinsen's dogma). The correct three-dimensional structure is essential to\n\nTitle: Protein folding\nText:  function, although some parts of functional proteins may remain unfolded, indicating that protein dynamics are important. Failure to fold into a native structure generally produces inactive proteins, but in some instances, misfolded proteins have modified or toxic functionality. Several neurodegenerative and other diseases are believed to result from the accumulation of amyloid fibrils formed by misfolded proteins, the infectious varieties of which are known as prions. Many allergies are caused by incorrect folding of some proteins because the immune system does not produce the antibodies for certain protein structures. Denaturation of proteins is a process of transition from a folded to an unfolded state. It happens in cooking, burns, proteinopathies, and other contexts. The duration of the folding process varies dramatically depending on the protein of interest. When studied outside the cell, the slowest folding proteins require many minutes or hours to fold, primarily due to proline isomerization, and must pass through a number of intermediate states, like checkpoints, before the process is complete. On the other hand, very small single-domain proteins with lengths of up to a hundred amino acids typically fold in a single step. Time scales of milliseconds are the norm, and the fastest known protein folding reactions are complete within a few microseconds.

Although the exact mechanism for Harlequin syndrome is still unclear, understanding what is affected with this syndrome is important.

The equivalence class of a set \"A\" under this relation, then, consists of all those sets which have the same cardinality as \"A\". There are two ways to define the \"cardinality of a set\": 1. The cardinality of a set \"A\" is defined as its equivalence class under equinumerosity. 2. A representative set is designated for each equivalence class. The most common choice is the initial ordinal in that class. This is usually taken as the definition of cardinal number in axiomatic set theory. Assuming the axiom of choice, the cardinalities of the infinite sets are denoted For each ordinal formula_11, formula_12 is the least cardinal number greater than formula_13. The cardinality of the natural numbers is denoted aleph-null (formula_14), while the cardinality of the real numbers is denoted\n\nTitle: Cardinality\nText: X\" = {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"} and \"Y\" = {apples, oranges, peaches}, where \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" are distinct, then |\u2009\"X\"\u2009| = |\u2009\"Y\"\u2009| because { (\"a\", apples), (\"b\", oranges), (\"c\", peaches)} is a bijection between the sets \"X\" and \"Y\". The cardinality of each of \"X\" and \"Y\" is 3. - If |\u2009\"X\"\u2009| \u2264 |\u2009\"Y\"\u2009|, then there exists \"Z\" such that |\u2009\"X\"\u2009| = |\u2009\"Z\"\u2009| and \"Z\" \u2286 \"Y\". - If |\u2009\"X\"\u2009| \u2264 |\u2009\"Y\"\u2009| and |\u2009\"Y\"\u2009| \u2264 |\u2009\"X\"\u2009|, then |\u2009\"X\"\u2009| = |\u2009\"Y\"\u2009|. This holds even for infinite cardinals, and is known as Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schroeder theorem. - Sets with cardinal\n\nTitle: Cardinality\nText: Cardinality In mathematics, the cardinality of a set is a measure of the number of elements of the set. For example, the set formula_1 contains 3 elements, and therefore formula_2 has a cardinality of 3. Beginning in the late 19th century, this concept was generalized to infinite sets, which allows one to distinguish between different types of infinity, and to perform arithmetic on them. There are two approaches to cardinality: one which compares sets directly using bijections and injections, and another which uses cardinal numbers. The cardinality of a set is also called its size, when no confusion with other notions of size is possible. The cardinality of a set formula_2 is usually denoted formula_4, with a vertical bar on each side; this is the same notation as absolute value, and the meaning depends on context. The cardinality of a set formula_2 may alternatively be denoted by formula_6, formula_2, formula_8, or formula_9.History. A crude sense of cardinality, an awareness that groups of things or events compare with other groups by containing more, fewer, or the same number of instances, is observed in a variety of present-day animal species, suggesting an\n\n"}], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [{"atom": "The mode of action of teriparatide is to increase activity in osteoclasts.", "is_supported": false, "idx": 1, "wiki_context": "Title: Teriparatide\nText: ter plc has been authorized in the European Union.

In the animal studies and in one human case report, it was found to potentially be associated with developing osteosarcoma in test subjects after over two years of use.Adverse effects. Adverse effects of teriparatide include headache, nausea, dizziness, and limb pain. Teriparatide has a theoretical risk of osteosarcoma, which was found in rat studies but not confirmed in humans. This may be because, unlike humans, rat bones grow for their entire life. The tumors found in the rat studies were located on the end of the bones which grew after the injections began. After nine years on the market, there were only two cases of osteosarcoma reported. This risk was considered by the FDA as \"extremely rare\" (1 in 100,000 people) and is only slightly more than the incidence in the population over 60 years old (0.4 in 100,000).Mechanism of action\n\nTitle: Teriparatide\nText: . Teriparatide is a portion of human parathyroid hormone (PTH), amino acid sequence 1 through 34, of the complete molecule (containing 84 amino acids). Endogenous PTH is the primary regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. PTH increases serum calcium, partially accomplishing this by increasing bone resorption. Thus, chronically elevated PTH will deplete bone stores. However, intermittent exposure to PTH will activate osteoblasts more than osteoclasts. Thus, once-daily injections of teriparatide have a net effect of stimulating new bone formation leading to increased bone mineral density.Society and culture.Society and culture.:Legal status. Teriparatide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1987.

These controls include the action of several hormones, including parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D, growth hormone, steroids, and calcitonin, as well as several bone marrow-derived membrane and soluble cytokines and growth factors (e.g. M-CSF, RANKL, VEGF and IL-6 family). It is in this way that the body is able to maintain proper levels of calcium required for physiological processes. Thus bone remodeling is not just occasional \"repair of bone damage\" but rather an active, continual process that is always happening in a healthy body. Subsequent to appropriate signaling, osteoclasts move to resorb the surface of the bone, followed by deposition of bone by osteoblasts. Together, the cells that are responsible for bone remodeling are known as the basic multicellular unit (BMU), and the temporal duration (i.e. lifespan) of the BMU is referred to as the bone remodeling period.See also. - Biomineralization, the general class of forming and maintaining mineralized tissues - Tissue remodeling - Wolff's law\n\nTitle: Bone remodeling\nText: Bone remodeling Bone remodeling (or bone metabolism) is a lifelong process where mature bone tissue is removed from the skeleton (a process called \"bone resorption\") and new bone tissue is formed (a process called \"ossification\" or \"new bone formation\"). These processes also control the reshaping or replacement of bone following injuries like fractures but also micro-damage, which occurs during normal activity. Remodeling responds also to functional demands of the mechanical loading. In the first year of life, almost 100% of the skeleton is replaced. In adults, remodeling proceeds at about 10% per year. An imbalance in the regulation of bone remodeling's two sub-processes, bone resorption and bone formation, results in many metabolic bone diseases, such as osteoporosis.Physiology. Bone homeostasis involves multiple but coordinated cellular and molecular events. Two main types of cells are responsible for bone metabolism: osteoblasts (which secrete new bone), and osteoclasts (which break bone down). The structure of bones as well as adequate supply of calcium requires close cooperation between these two cell types and other cell populations present at the bone remodeling sites (e.g. immune cells). Bone metabolism relies on complex signaling pathways\n\n"}], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [{"atom": "Miravirsen is essential for hepatitis C virus replication.", "is_supported": false, "idx": 7, "wiki_context": "Title: Hepatitis C\nText: itaprevir/ritonavir with dasabuvir or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir with either daclatasvir or simeprevir. - HCV genotype 1b (with compensated cirrhosis): 12 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.

Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic conditions, such as xeroderma pigmentosum, also increase the risk. Diagnosis is by biopsy and analysis of any skin lesion that has signs of being potentially cancerous. Using sunscreen and avoiding UV light may prevent melanoma.

Certain types of melanoma have worse prognoses but this is explained by their thickness. Less invasive melanomas even with lymph node metastases carry a better prognosis than deep melanomas without regional metastasis at time of staging. Local recurrences tend to behave similarly to a primary unless they are at the site of a wide local excision (as opposed to a staged excision or punch/shave excision) since these recurrences tend to indicate lymphatic invasion. When melanomas have spread to the lymph nodes, one of the most important factors is the number of nodes with malignancy. Extent of malignancy within a node is also important; micrometastases in which malignancy is only microscopic have a more favorable prognosis than macrometastases. In some cases micrometastases may only be detected by special staining, and if malignancy is only detectable by a rarely employed test known as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the prognosis is better.

Doctors can generally distinguish seborrheic keratosis from melanoma upon examination or with dermatoscopy. Some advocate replacing \"enlarging\" with \"evolving\": moles that change and evolve are a concern. Alternatively, some practitioners prefer \"elevation\". Elevation can help identify a melanoma, but lack of elevation does not mean that the lesion is not a melanoma. Most melanomas in the US are detected before they become elevated. By the time elevation is visible, they may have progressed to the more dangerous invasive stage. In-person inspection of suspicious skin lesions is more accurate than visual inspection of images of suspicious skin lesions.

The general factor of IQ tests is referred to as the \"g\" factor, and it typically accounts for 40 to 50 percent of the variance in IQ test batteries. The presence of correlations between many widely varying cognitive tests has often been taken as evidence for the existence of \"g\", but McFarland (2012) showed that such correlations do not provide any more or less support for the existence of \"g\" than for the existence of multiple factors of intelligence. Charles Spearman developed factor analysis in order to study correlations between tests. Initially, he developed a model of intelligence in which variations in all intelligence test scores are explained by only two kinds of variables: first, factors that are specific to each test (denoted \"s\"); and second, a \"g\" factor that accounts for the positive correlations across tests. This is known as Spearman's two-factor theory. Later research based on more diverse test batteries than those used by Spearman demonstrated that \"g\" alone could not account for all correlations between tests.

It has been shown that it is not possible to distinguish statistically between Spearman's model of \"g\" and the sampling model; both are equally able to account for intercorrelations among tests. The sampling theory is also consistent with the observation that more complex mental tasks have higher \"g\" loadings, because more complex tasks are expected to involve a larger sampling of neural elements and therefore have more of them in common with other tasks. Some researchers have argued that the sampling model invalidates \"g\" as a psychological concept, because the model suggests that \"g\" factors derived from different test batteries simply reflect the shared elements of the particular tests contained in each battery rather than a \"g\" that is common to all tests. Similarly, high correlations between different batteries could be due to them measuring the same set of abilities rather than \"the\" same ability. Critics have argued that the sampling theory is incongruent with certain empirical findings.

By contrast, Cas9 requires both crRNA and a transactivating crRNA (tracrRNA). These differences may give Cas12a some advantages over Cas9.

Other imprinted genes are involved in post-natal development, with roles affecting suckling and metabolism.Imprinted genes in mammals.:Hypotheses on the origins of imprinting. A widely accepted hypothesis for the evolution of genomic imprinting is the \"parental conflict hypothesis\". Also known as the kinship theory of genomic imprinting, this hypothesis states that the inequality between parental genomes due to imprinting is a result of the differing interests of each parent in terms of the evolutionary fitness of their genes. The father's genes that encode for imprinting gain greater fitness through the success of the offspring, at the expense of the mother. The mother's evolutionary imperative is often to conserve resources for her own survival while providing sufficient nourishment to current and subsequent litters. Accordingly, paternally expressed genes tend to be growth-promoting whereas maternally expressed genes tend to be growth-limiting. In support of this hypothesis, genomic imprinting has been found in all placental mammals, where post-fertilisation offspring resource consumption at the expense of the mother is high; although it has also been found in ovipar\n\nTitle: Genomic imprinting\nText: ous birds where there is relatively little post-fertilisation resource transfer and therefore less parental conflict. A small number of imprinted genes are fast evolving under positive Darwinian selection possibly due to antagonistic co-evolution. The majority of imprinted genes display high levels of micro-synteny conservation and have undergone very few duplications in placental mammalian lineages. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind genomic imprinting show that it is the maternal genome that controls much of the imprinting of both its own and the paternally-derived genes in the zygote, making it difficult to explain why the maternal genes would willingly relinquish their dominance to that of the paternally-derived genes in light of the conflict hypothesis. Another hypothesis proposed is that some imprinted genes act coadaptively to improve both fetal development and maternal provisioning for nutrition and care. In it, a subset of paternally expressed genes are co-expressed in both the placenta and the mother's hypothalamus. This would come about through selective pressure from parent-infant coadaptation to improve infant survival. Paternally expressed 3 (\"PEG3\") is a gene for which this hypothesis may apply.

Genes can also be partially imprinted. Partial imprinting occurs when alleles from both parents are differently expressed rather than complete expression and complete suppression of one parent's allele. Forms of genomic imprinting have been demonstrated in fungi, plants and animals. In 2014, there were about 150 imprinted genes known in mice and about half that in humans. As of 2019, 260 imprinted genes have been reported in mice and 228 in humans. Genomic imprinting is an inheritance process independent of the classical Mendelian inheritance. It is an epigenetic process that involves DNA methylation and histone methylation without altering the genetic sequence. These epigenetic marks are established (\"imprinted\") in the germline (sperm or egg cells) of the parents and are maintained through mitotic cell divisions in the somatic cells of an organism. Appropriate imprinting of certain genes is important for normal development. Human diseases involving genomic imprinting include Angelman, Prader\u2013Willi, and Beckwith\u2013Wiedemann syndromes.

Participants give consent for their genome data to be linked to information about their medical condition and health records. The medical and genomic data is shared with researchers to improve knowledge of the causes, treatment, and care of diseases.History. The project was first announced by UK Prime Minister David Cameron in December 2012. The Government set up a new company Genomics England to oversee the project with the plan to focus on rare diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases announced by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt in July 2013. The project was also made possible by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), NHS England, Public Health England, and Health Education England. In 2015, Northern Ireland and Scotland also joined the project with plans to start work the following year.

In addition, TNF receptors are found on the surface of virtually all nucleated cells (red blood cells, which are not nucleated, do not contain TNF receptors on their surface). Etanercept mimics the inhibitory effects of naturally occurring soluble TNF receptors, the difference being that etanercept, because it is a fusion protein rather than a simple TNF receptor, has a greatly extended half-life in the bloodstream, and therefore a more profound and long-lasting biologic effect than a naturally occurring soluble TNF receptor.Structure.

These products are often proteins, but in non-protein-coding genes such as transfer RNA (tRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA), the product is a functional non-coding RNA. Gene expression is summarized in the central dogma of molecular biology first formulated by Francis Crick in 1958, further developed in his 1970 article, and expanded by the subsequent discoveries of reverse transcription and RNA replication. The process of gene expression is used by all known life\u2014eukaryotes (including multicellular organisms), prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), and utilized by viruses\u2014to generate the macromolecular machinery for life. In genetics, gene expression is the most fundamental level at which the genotype gives rise to the phenotype, \"i.e.\" observable trait. The genetic information stored in DNA represents the genotype, whereas the phenotype results from the \"interpretation\" of that information. Such phenotypes are often displayed by the synthesis of proteins that control the organism's structure and development\n\nTitle: Gene expression\nText: -throughput analysis of many genes within a sample, quantitative PCR may be performed for hundreds of genes simultaneously in the case of low-density arrays. A second approach is the hybridization microarray. A single array or \"chip\" may contain probes to determine transcript levels for every known gene in the genome of one or more organisms. Alternatively, \"tag based\" technologies like Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and RNA-Seq, which can provide a relative measure of the cellular concentration of different mRNAs, can be used. An advantage of tag-based methods is the \"open architecture\", allowing for the exact measurement of any transcript, with a known or unknown sequence. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) such as RNA-Seq is another approach, producing vast quantities of sequence data that can be matched to a reference genome. Although NGS is comparatively time-consuming, expensive, and resource-intensive, it can identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms, splice-variants, and novel genes, and can also be used to profile expression in organisms for which little or no sequence information is available.Measurement.:RNA profiles in Wikipedia.

Arousal is mediated by several neural systems. Wakefulness is regulated by the ARAS, which is composed of projections from five major neurotransmitter systems that originate in the brainstem and form connections extending throughout the cortex; activity within the ARAS is regulated by neurons that release the neurotransmitters acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, histamine, and serotonin. Activation of these neurons produces an increase in cortical activity and subsequently alertness. Arousal is important in regulating consciousness, attention, alertness, and information processing. It is crucial for motivating certain behaviours, such as mobility, the pursuit of nutrition, the fight-or-flight response and sexual activity (the arousal phase of Masters and Johnson's human sexual response cycle).

Endoscopy is typically normal in patients with\n\nTitle: Nutcracker esophagus\nText: Nutcracker esophagus Nutcracker esophagus, jackhammer esophagus, or hypercontractile peristalsis, is a disorder of the movement of the esophagus characterized by contractions in the smooth muscle of the esophagus in a normal sequence but at an excessive amplitude or duration. Nutcracker esophagus is one of several motility disorders of the esophagus, including achalasia and diffuse esophageal spasm. It causes difficulty swallowing, or dysphagia, with both solid and liquid foods, and can cause significant chest pain; it may also be asymptomatic. Nutcracker esophagus can affect people of any age but is more common in the sixth and seventh decades of life. The diagnosis is made by an esophageal motility study (esophageal manometry), which evaluates the pressure of the esophagus at various points along its length. The term \"nutcracker esophagus\" comes from the finding of increased pressures during peristalsis, with a diagnosis made when pressures exceed 180 mmHg; this has been likened to the pressure of a mechanical nutcracker. The disorder does not progress, and is not associated with any complications; as\n\nTitle: Nutcracker esophagus\nText:  a result, treatment of nutcracker esophagus targets control of symptoms only.Signs and symptoms. Nutcracker esophagus is characterized as a motility disorder of the esophagus, meaning that it is caused by abnormal movement, or peristalsis of the esophagus. People with motility disorders present with two main symptoms: chest pain or difficulty with swallowing. Chest pain is the more common. The chest pain is very severe and intense, and mimics cardiac chest pain. It may spread into the arm and back. The symptoms of nutcracker esophagus are intermittent, and may occur with or without food. Rarely, patients can present with a sudden obstruction of the esophagus after eating food (termed a food bolus obstruction, or the'steakhouse syndrome') requiring urgent treatment. The disorder does not progress to produce worsening symptoms or complications, unlike other motility disorders (such as achalasia) or anatomical abnormalities of the esophagus (such as peptic strictures or esophageal cancer). Many patients with nutcracker esophagus do not have any symptoms at all, as esophageal manometry studies done on patients without symptoms may show the same motility findings as\n\n"}], [], [], []], "wrong_facts": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [{"atom": "Ear acupressure is a type of acupuncture.", "idx": 2}], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [{"atom": "Spastic diplegia is diagnosed through imaging studies.", "idx": 2}], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [{"atom": "The sentence includes a list that starts with \"1.\".", "idx": 3}], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [{"atom": "The effect of ivabradine in HFpEF is to potentially improve left ventricular (LV) contractility.", "idx": 3}], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [{"atom": "The decrease in costs is specifically for ACE inhibitors.", "idx": 2}], [{"atom": "The effectiveness of dendritic cells treatment on cancer is mentioned in the first paragraph.", "idx": 2}], [], [], [{"atom": "Trimetazidine (TMZ) activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling.", "idx": 2}], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [{"atom": "The \"2\" could refer to a specific quantity, sample number, or experimental condition, but without additional context, its significance is unclear.\n\nPlease provide additional context if you need a more detailed breakdown or specific information.", "idx": 3}, {"atom": "The number 4 is associated with H2BK5me1.", "idx": 5}], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [{"atom": "The most frequent non-canonical sequence motifs at acceptor splice sites in vertebrates are AT-AC.", "idx": 2}], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [{"atom": "The interaction between TSC1 and PLK1 results in an effect.", "idx": 1}, {"atom": "TSC1 negatively regulates the protein levels of PLK1.", "idx": 2}], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [{"atom": "The therapeutic interventions for sarcopenia have been applied.", "idx": 0}], [], [], [], [], [{"atom": "Disrupting the transcriptome promotes histone eviction.", "idx": 3}], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [{"atom": "Erythropoietin (EPO) can be used as a monotherapy for cardiac regeneration.", "idx": 4}], [], [], [], [], [], [{"atom": "The number \"3\" is associated with surgical excision (context unclear).", "idx": 8}], [], [], [], [{"atom": "The number \"4\" is associated with the alteration of paraspeckle integrity.\n\nWithout additional context or information, further breakdown may not be feasible.

{"input": "Leprosy remains a public health problem in Brazil with new case incidence exceeding World Health Organization ( WHO ) goals in endemic clusters throughout the country . Migration can facilitate movement of disease between endemic and non-endemic areas , and has been considered a possible factor in continued leprosy incidence in Brazil . A study was conducted to investigate migration as a risk factor for leprosy . The study had three aims: ( 1 ) examine past five year migration as a risk factor for leprosy , ( 2 ) describe and compare geographic and temporal patterns of migration among past 5-year migrants with leprosy and a control group , and ( 3 ) examine social determinants of health associated with leprosy among past 5-year migrants . The study implemented a matched case-control design and analysis comparing individuals newly diagnosed with leprosy ( n\u200a=\u200a340 ) and a clinically unapparent control group ( n\u200a=\u200a340 ) without clinical signs of leprosy , matched for age , sex and location in four endemic municipalities in the state of Maranh\u00e3o , northeastern Brazil . Fishers exact test was used to conduct bivariate analyses . A multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to control for possible confounding variables . Eighty cases ( 23 . 5% ) migrated 5-years prior to diagnosis , and 55 controls ( 16 . 2% ) migrated 5-years prior to the corresponding case diagnosis . Past 5 year migration was found to be associated with leprosy ( OR: 1 . 59; 95% CI 1 . 07\u20132 . 38; p\u200a=\u200a0 . 02 ) , and remained significantly associated with leprosy after controlling for leprosy contact in the family , household , and family/household contact . Poverty , as well as leprosy contact in the family , household and other leprosy contact , was associated with leprosy among past 5-year migrants in the bivariate analysis . Alcohol consumption was also associated with leprosy , a relevant risk factor in susceptibility to infection that should be explored in future research . Our findings provide insight into patterns of migration to localize focused control efforts in endemic areas with high population mobility .\nLeprosy continues to be an endemic disease in many parts of the world . Brazil has globally the second highest new case incidence [1] . National leprosy prevalence of 1 . 54/10 , 000 in 2010 [2] remains above the WHO goal of <1 per 10 , 000 . Highly endemic areas of the disease continue to persist despite large-scale national efforts to control the disease . A challenge in disease control efforts is compounded as leprosy can be diagnosed many years after infection took place due to the long incubation period , and mild early symptoms of the disease may be overlooked . Migration has been found to be a social determinant of disease [3] , and has been hypothesized as a risk factor in continued leprosy incidence [4] , [5] , [6] . In fact , earlier research in Brazil highlighted the increased distribution of leprosy along new corridors coinciding with frontier expansion connecting southern agricultural areas to the north of Brazil [7] , as well as periurban migrant settlements on the outskirts of urban centers [4] . Migrants move between endemic and non-endemic areas in Brazil and often live in substandard conditions . As an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae , leprosy primarily affects the skin and peripheral nerves and causing sensory loss . While nasal mucosa is considered the main transmission site , new research indicates that oral presence of M . leprae bacilli may be an additional mode of transmission [8] . Maranh\u00e3o , the study area of this research , has the third highest prevalence of leprosy ( 5 . 34/10 , 000 ) in the country [2] and is among the states with the highest out- and return- migration rates [9] . The proliferation of leprosy in Brazil continues largely in conditions of poverty that include poor housing and sanitation , high household density , illiteracy and low socioeconomic levels both at the micro and macro levels [4] , [10]\u2013[13] . Rapid population growth and uncontrolled urbanization , often as a consequence of migration for employment and differential access to services between rural and urban areas , has facilitated the expansion of these poor social and environmental conditions on the peripheries of cities associated with leprosy infection [4]\u2013[5] , [7] , [13] . Additionally , new road construction and railways have enabled movement between rural communities and urban areas . These developments in transportation have been argued to explain the expanded distribution of leprosy in Brazil [4]\u2013[6] . Nevertheless , household leprosy contact continues to be the primary risk factor associated with leprosy infection [14] . Proximity to the household contact has been seen as relevant in terms of increased risk [15] . Consanguineous contact has also been found to be associated with leprosy . Findings from Moet et al . ( 2006 ) suggest evidence of a genetic relationship independent of physical contact for leprosy infection . Migration has been found to be an impediment to both leprosy elimination and control efforts . Prior research has suggested that migration may influence transmission and distribution of the disease [5] , [16] as well as other neglected tropical diseases ( NTDs ) [3] , [17]\u2013[23] . This study explores the spatial and temporal patterns of migration in individuals with leprosy in Maranh\u00e3o . The study also examines risk factors associated with leprosy among individuals who have migrated in the past five years ( past 5-year migrants ) . Comparison of risks associated with leprosy and migration is challenging in a homogeneous population . However evaluation of specific risk factors that differentiate leprosy among past 5-year migrants from a clinically unapparent control group without clinical signs of leprosy who migrated in the past five years in this investigation , sheds light on those factors that are of importance when considering leprosy infection and expression of disease . The study has three specific aims: 1 ) to examine if migration in the past five years is a risk factor for leprosy; 2 ) to describe and compare geographic and temporal patterns of migration among past 5-year migrants with leprosy and a control group without clinical signs of leprosy; 3 ) to examine the social determinants of health associated with leprosy among past 5-year migrants .\nWritten approval was obtained from the Ethical Review Board of the Federal University of Cear\u00e1 ( Fortaleza , Brazil ) . Permission to perform the study was also obtained by the Maranh\u00e3o State Health Secretariat , the State Leprosy Control Program and municipalities involved . Informed written consent was obtained from study participants , or their parent/guardian in the case of minors , after explaining the objectives of the study . Interviews were conducted in private . The research was conducted in four leprosy endemic municipalities in the state of Maranh\u00e3o , Brazil: Santa In\u00eas , S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Ribamar , Cod\u00f3 , and Bacabal . These municipalities are located in a major endemic cluster identified by the Brazilian Ministry of Health as a high-risk area for leprosy transmission [16] . Santa In\u00eas , ( population 77 , 282 ) [24] , Cod\u00f3 ( population 118 , 038 ) [24] , and Bacabal ( population 100 , 014 same ) [24] are small townships in the interior of Maranh\u00e3o that are largely surrounded by rural agricultural production , while S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Ribamar ( population 163 , 045 ) [24] is on the outskirts of the capital city , S\u00e3o Luis . Most households are small brick or mud and palm residences with rudimentary plumbing and hammocks to accommodate the multigenerational inhabitants . A case-control study was designed as part of an extended epidemiological investigation on risk factors associated with leprosy infection in four highly endemic municipalities in Maranh\u00e3o , as part of the MAPATOPI study . The MAPATOPI study is an interdisciplinary project to support and improve the Brazilian leprosy program in Maranh\u00e3o , Par\u00e1 , Tocantins , and Piaui . Variables associated with past five year migration among those diagnosed with leprosy between 2009\u20132010 were compared with a matched clinically unapparent control group without clinical signs of leprosy . Migration was defined as those who resided outside of the municipality of their current residence , and is limited to five years as this is the average incubation period from leprosy infection to symptom onset . Past five year migration data is also collected in the Brazilian National Household Survey [9] . A detailed analysis of socio-cultural , health service related and economic variables that were collected as part of the larger epidemiological study will be explored elsewhere . The case group was identified through the database of the National Information System for Notifiable Diseases ( Sistema de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o de Agravos de Notifica\u00e7\u00e3o \u2013 SINAN ) and included adults 15 and older in each of the four sites diagnosed with leprosy in 2009\u20132010 ( n\u200a=\u200a394 ) . Individuals under 15 years of age , those previously diagnosed with leprosy and relapsed , living outside of the highly endemic cluster and who could not be located through multiple contact attempts were excluded from the study . The control group ( n\u200a=\u200a391 ) was selected from the Programa Sa\u00fade da Fam\u00edlia ( Program for Family Health ) . This program registers all families in the catchment areas of the clinic by community health workers . At the clinics , we randomly selected intake forms from the Program for Family Health for age and sex at each clinic and contacted those individuals for inclusion in the control group . Each of the matched controls were clinically evaluated for signs of leprosy . Any individual with a clinical suspicion of leprosy was excluded from the study and referred to municipal health centers for further diagnostic testing . Data collection was conducted between April and August 2010 . Data collection was coordinated through the Municipality Health Secretariats with the support of the Maranh\u00e3o State Health Secretariat . Study participants were recruited by community health agents for the study . They were interviewed by trained health professionals at the local health care centers , or in patient homes when disability or age prevented health center attendance . Information on demographics , socioeconomic status , healthcare access , migration , behavior and stress was collected through structured questionnaires . Clinical data were also collected through patient medical records . Data were entered twice using EpiInfo software version 3 . 5 . 1 ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Atlanta , USA ) and cross-checked for entry-related errors . Statistical tests were used to assess normality . Included are data sets with information related to migration . Any cases that did not have complete migration data were excluded from the analysis . Of the 340 leprosy cases and 340 matched controls , we first identified 135 ( 19 . 9% ) past 5-year migrants in the case ( n\u200a=\u200a80 ) and control groups ( n\u200a=\u200a55 ) . The distribution of key demographic , spatial and temporal migration pattern variables among past 5-year migrants in the case and control groups was examined and tested by the use of Fishers exact test for significant differences in the stratified sample of past 5-year migrants . We then conducted bivariate analyses comparing cases ( n\u200a=\u200a340 ) and controls ( n\u200a=\u200a340 ) using Fishers exact test to examine if past five year migration was associated with leprosy diagnosis . As household contact remains the most significant known transmission risk to date for leprosy infection [14] , [15] , we additionally undertook multivariate logistic regression analysis controlling for family ( parent , child and/or sibling ) and household ( consanguineous and/or non-consanguineous ) contact with leprosy . Next , stratified bivariate analyses using Fishers exact tests were used to determine differences in the association among social determinants of health ( socioeconomic status ) , psychosocial ( alcohol use and life stressors ) and biosocial factors ( leprosy contact exposure ) for case and control groups of past 5-year migrants ( n\u200a=\u200a135 ) .\nA total of 394 leprosy cases and 391 controls were interviewed . There were 23 relapsed leprosy cases and 12 controls suspected of leprosy who were excluded from the study . Eight respondents refused to participate . Complete migration data was available for 680 respondents . Of the 340 leprosy cases and 340 matched clinically unapparent controls , 23 . 5% of those with leprosy ( n\u200a=\u200a80 cases ) and 16 . 2% ( n\u200a=\u200a55 ) of the control group without clinical signs of leprosy migrated in the past 5 years before diagnosis . Only 4 . 4% ( n\u200a=\u200a15 ) of cases migrated after diagnosis . Table 1 reflects migration into and out of major endemic clusters identified by the Brazilian Ministry of Health as high-risk areas for leprosy transmission [6] ( Figure 1 ) , and other demographics and migration variables . These variables were not significantly associated with leprosy among past 5-year migrants prior to diagnosis ( test results not shown ) . Leprosy cases were largely among the youngest age group ( 15\u201329 ) migrating , with an equal distribution between males and females . More than one-third of those with leprosy who migrated in the past five years were illiterate . The majority of leprosy cases migrated within cluster 1 , which includes the northern states of Par\u00e1 , Piau\u00ed , Tocantins and Maranh\u00e3o . More than half ( 56 . 3% ) of cases moved between municipalities in Maranh\u00e3o , followed with fewer cases to neighboring Par\u00e1 ( 11 . 8% ) , Piau\u00ed ( 3 . 9% ) and Tocantins ( 2 . 0% ) , and one-fifth of migrants were drawn to non-contiguous states . All those with leprosy migrated into a highly endemic cluster on at least one occasion , not including their current residence . Nearly one in six migrants with leprosy migrated for employment in the last five years and this was slightly less than expected for internal population movement . Typical of internal population flow , most migration in Maranh\u00e3o was to urban areas ( 60 . 3% ) compared to rural areas ( 33 . 3% ) , and both rural and urban areas ( 7 . 7% ) . Social networks in migration destination sites for those with leprosy had a higher tendency to be family contacts with whom they lived ( 81 . 0% ) than work contacts ( 17 . 7% ) . This may be an explanation for the significant number of respondents who always had a contact prior to migrating ( 79 . 8% ) . Migrants with leprosy lived on average with 8 . 61 people per household while migrating . Past five year migration prior to diagnosis was found to be significantly associated with leprosy as shown in Table 2 which represents the results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis . Past five year migration remained significantly associated with leprosy after controlling in separate models for 1 ) household contact ( consanguineous and/or non-consanguineous ) ; 2 ) family contact ( parent , child and/or sibling; 3 ) and household and family contact in multiple logistic regression models . Key social , biosocial , and behavioral factors were found to be associated with leprosy ( Table 3 ) . Household , familial and other contact with someone infected with leprosy was significantly different for leprosy infected past 5-year migrants compared to control group migrants . Genetic association of closely related kinship shows a significant difference for contact with parent/child/sibling ( OR: 7 . 82; CI 95%: 2 . 32\u201333 . 38; P-value\u200a=\u200a0 . 0001 ) . Contact regardless of consanguinity ( OR: 4 . 99; CI 95%: 1 . 7\u201316 . 51; P-value\u200a=\u200a0 . 001 ) and actual household contact ( OR: 5 . 54; CI 95%: 1 . 49\u201330 . 46; P-value\u200a=\u200a0 . 004 ) was also significant . An important behavioral factor distinguishing migrants with leprosy compared to the clinically unapparent control group was past five year alcohol consumption ( OR: 4 . 46; CI 95%: 1 . 43\u201314 . 15; P-value\u200a=\u200a0 . 005 ) . Income and other socioeconomic variables showed significant differences between migrants with leprosy and the control group . Income less than the minimum wage ( OR: 2 . 12; CI 95%: 0 . 97\u20134 . 71; p-value\u200a=\u200a0 . 049 ) as well as poor access to public waste services ( OR: 3 . 1; CI 95%: 1 . 1\u201310 . 02; p-value\u200a=\u200a0 . 03 ) and family illiteracy ( OR: 2 . 67; CI 95%: 1 . 13\u20136 . 51; p-value\u200a=\u200a0 . 02 ) were found to be associated with leprosy among past 5-year migrants . Education , presence of BCG scar , zone of residence and lifestyle stressors - separation from family and friends , loss of employment or income , marital separation or death of close friend or relative- were not significantly associated with leprosy among past five year migrants .\nLeprosy was found to be associated with past five year migration , even after controlling for confounders . In the comparison of past 5-year migrants , leprosy was associated with both household consanguineous and/or non-consanguineous contact , close family and other social leprosy contact , consistent with research identifying contact exposure as the major determinant of leprosy transmission [14]\u2013[15] . However , the magnitude of effect for leprosy among migrants in our study was most significant among close family and household contacts . As migration in Maranh\u00e3o was largely facilitated through family networks , contact surveillance should include migration site residence contacts as well as current residence contacts . While patterns of migration , including movement in and between highly endemic clusters , were not different among migrants with leprosy and clinically unapparent migrants in the control group , important facets of migration emerged that could benefit leprosy control at the state and national level . State control programs should consider monitoring past five year residence among those newly diagnosed with leprosy to identify intra- and inter-state migration flow . This may provide early warning systems for localized disease control in areas yet to be identified as high-risk areas . Alcohol consumption in the years prior to diagnosis may be associated with susceptibility to leprosy . Alcohol consumption and consumption frequency should be included in future investigations . This research will help to determine the extent that alcohol consumption plays a role in the dynamics of both transmission and expression of leprosy . As alcohol consumption has also been associated with leprosy relapse , further attention should be given to alcohol consumption during treatment , patient relapse and contact exposure to leprosy . Other substances should also be given attention in future research . Other research in Brazil has found a spatial relationship to migration and distribution of leprosy and an association of leprosy with poor socio-economic conditions [4]\u2013[6] . Our research shows that in endemic areas leprosy is not only associated with population movement itself , but , most importantly with the social conditions of the migrant in the endemic areas , their behavior , and contact with leprosy in the family and household .", "output": "**Leprosy in Brazil: Understanding the Role of Migration in Disease Spread**\n\nLeprosy, a bacterial disease that affects the skin and nerves, remains a significant public health problem in Brazil, with new cases exceeding World Health Organization (WHO) goals in many parts of the country. Researchers have long suspected that migration, or the movement of people from one place to another, may play a role in the spread of leprosy. A recent study aimed to investigate this hypothesis and shed light on the relationship between migration and leprosy in Brazil.\n\n**The Study**\n\nThe study, conducted in four highly endemic municipalities in the state of Maranh\u00e3o, northeastern Brazil, involved interviewing 340 people who had been diagnosed with leprosy and 340 people without the disease, matched for age, sex, and location. The researchers collected data on the participants' migration history, social determinants of health, and other factors that may be associated with leprosy.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\nThe study found that past five-year migration was significantly associated with leprosy, even after controlling for other factors such as household and family contact with leprosy.

{"input": "Lying at the heart of many vital cellular processes such as photosynthesis and respiration , biological electron transfer ( ET ) is mediated by transient interactions among proteins that recognize multiple binding partners . Accurate description of the ET complexes \u2013 necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the cellular signaling and metabolism \u2013 is compounded by their short lifetimes and pronounced binding promiscuity . Here , we used a computational approach relying solely on the steric properties of the individual proteins to predict the ET properties of protein complexes constituting the functional interactome of the eukaryotic cytochrome c ( Cc ) . Cc is a small , soluble , highly-conserved electron carrier protein that coordinates the electron flow among different redox partners . In eukaryotes , Cc is a key component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain , where it shuttles electrons between its reductase and oxidase , and an essential electron donor or acceptor in a number of other redox systems . Starting from the structures of individual proteins , we performed extensive conformational sampling of the ET-competent binding geometries , which allowed mapping out functional epitopes in the Cc complexes , estimating the upper limit of the ET rate in a given system , assessing ET properties of different binding stoichiometries , and gauging the effect of domain mobility on the intermolecular ET . The resulting picture of the Cc interactome 1 ) reveals that most ET-competent binding geometries are located in electrostatically favorable regions , 2 ) indicates that the ET can take place from more than one protein-protein orientation , and 3 ) suggests that protein dynamics within redox complexes , and not the electron tunneling event itself , is the rate-limiting step in the intermolecular ET . Further , we show that the functional epitope size correlates with the extent of dynamics in the Cc complexes and thus can be used as a diagnostic tool for protein mobility .\nMany vital cellular processes such as photosynthesis , respiration , and a variety of metabolic reactions rely on long-range electron transfer ( ET ) between macromolecules . In a biological context , the intermolecular ET involves formation of a redox complex , electron tunneling across a biomolecular interface , and dissociation of the reduced and oxidized products . While the electron tunneling is , arguably , the best described step in this sequence of events [1] , [2] , our understanding of the first and the last steps is often obscured by the macromolecular dynamics and the uncertainty of the binding geometries in reactive complexes [3] . Experimental study of the biomolecular ET in solution is further complicated by two factors . First , in order to maximize the overall turnover in the ET chain , redox complexes have short lifetimes and , consequently , low binding affinities , making structural characterization of these weak , transient , highly dynamic complexes difficult [4] . Second , unlike in other biomolecular interactions where formation of a functional complex requires precise alignment of the partner molecules , an efficient intermolecular ET can occur from more than one protein-protein orientation . This possible multitude of active binding geometries presents an additional challenge for an accurate description of the biomolecular ET . The observation that most of the transient ET complexes are formed by oppositely-charged proteins spurred numerous modeling studies , the earliest of which aimed at optimizing intermolecular electrostatic interactions and minimizing the separation between the binding partners' redox cofactors [5] , [6] . These were followed by more elaborate simulations [7]\u2013[11] , which revealed regions of attractive electrostatic potential containing a range of favorable protein-protein orientations [7]\u2013[9] , [12] or indicated possible binding-induced conformational changes [7] , [11] . However , crystal structures of ET protein complexes show very few charge-charge or polar contacts across the interfaces , with most of the interactions dominated by van der Waals ( vdW ) forces [13] . Moreover , in several systems , mutagenesis of the charged residues expected to stabilize transient protein-protein complexes shows little or no effect on the binding affinity and the ET rate [14]\u2013[16] . Thus , contrary to the conclusions of early modeling studies [5] , [6] , it appears that ET complexes are not optimized for intermolecular electrostatic interactions , which is thought to facilitate rapid dissociation required for a high turnover [13] . The current view is that charged residues \u2013 often located at the periphery of the binding sites \u2013 play a critical role in the early stages of protein-protein interactions by steering binding partners to form a loose encounter complex , but are less important for the ensuing formation of the specific , ET-active form , dominated by short-range forces [4] , [13] , [17] , [18] . In addition , electrostatic interactions can guide the partner proteins to productive docking geometries , without contributing to the overall binding affinity [19] . The discrepancies between the experimental results and the outcome of the electrostatics-based simulations highlight the need for alternative computational approaches . In this work , we used a modeling protocol based solely on steric properties of protein molecules to describe the ET network of eukaryotic cytochrome c ( Cc ) \u2013 a small , soluble , highly conserved hemoprotein . Cc is a key component of the eukaryotic respiratory chain , where it shuttles electrons between Cc reductase ( Cbc1 ) and Cc oxidase ( CCO ) [20] . Its other physiological redox partners include Cc peroxidase ( CcP ) [21] , sulfite oxidase ( SOX ) [22] , flavocytochrome b2 ( Fcb2 ) [23] , a flavin-dependent sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1 [24] , and possibly cytochrome b5 ( Cb5 ) [20] , [25] , [26] . In each of these systems , Cc acts as an electron donor or acceptor and serves as a hub coordinating the electron flow in the mitochondrial intermembrane space [26] . Starting from the structures of individual proteins , we performed extensive conformational sampling of possible ET-active binding geometries , which allowed mapping out functional epitopes in the Cc complexes , estimating the upper limit of the ET rate in a given system , assessing ET properties of different binding stoichiometries and , in the case of Cc complexes with SOX and Fcb2 , gauging the effect of domain mobility on the intermolecular ET .\nProtein coordinates were taken from the PDB; cofactor topologies and parameters were obtained from the HIC-Up database [27] . The ScErv1 structure was modeled with Modeller [28] based on the X-ray coordinates of the homologous protein AtErv1 [29] . Missing protein loops were built with Modeller [28] . Hydrogen atoms were added in Xplor-NIH using standard topology and parameter sets [30] . The ensembles of Fcb2 and SOX domain-domain orientations were generated in Xplor-NIH by simulated annealing in torsion angle space with standard protein geometry and vdW parameters and knowledge-based dihedral angle potentials [31] . Two domains were treated as rigid bodies , while the intervening linker segment ( residues 99\u2013100 or 89\u201399 for Fcb2; and residues 83\u201394 for SOX ) was allowed full flexibility . Detailed description of the systems studied is provided in the Table S1 . Conformational sampling was performed in Xplor-NIH [30] using a modified version of the published protocol [32] . The molecular system was oriented such that the centers of mass ( CM ) of the two interacting proteins appeared at the origin of the coordinate system and on the positive z axis . In a typical run , the Cc binding partner was kept stationary , while Cc was systematically rotated around x and z axes , corresponding to the \u03b8 and \u03c6 rotations in the spherical coordinate space ( Figure 1A ) . The desired spatial resolution , \u03b4d \u2013 defined here as the separation between neighboring CMs of the rotated protein and typically set to 1 \u00c5 \u2013 determines the \u03b4\u03b8 and \u03b4\u03c6 rotation increments and the total number of steps required to sample the entire conformational space ( Equations 1\u20133 ) . ( 1 ) where \u03b4d and d are the desired spatial resolution and the distance between CMs of the two proteins in the starting structure . Number of \u03b4\u03b8 rotational increments is given by n\u03b8\u200a=\u200a\u03c0/\u03b4\u03b8 , with the value rounded to the last digit before the decimal so that . For \u03b8 rotation around the x axis , the rotation matrix is given by: ( 2 ) Upon \u03b8 rotation , the ordinate of the Cc CM becomes y\u2032\u200a=\u200ad\u00b7sin\u03b8 . By symmetry with the Equation 1 , the \u03b4\u03c6i rotational increment at each \u03b8i is given by: ( 3 ) At each \u03b8i , the number of \u03b4\u03c6i rotational increments is given by n\u03c6 , i\u200a=\u200a2\u03c0/\u03b4\u03c6i , with the value rounded to the last digit before the decimal so that . For \u03c6 rotation around the z axis , the rotation matrix is given by: ( 4 ) The total number of the CMs defining the coverage of the conformational space is given by ( 5 ) To sample flat , irregular surfaces of the selected CCO and Cbc1 regions , the protocol was modified to include the initial translation of Cc along the long axis of the molecular system , followed by rotation around the same axis , both in increments required to produce 1 \u00c5 separation between neighboring Cc CMs . To simulate the rotational freedom , Cc was rotated around orthogonal \u03c7 , \u03c8 , \u03be axes originating at its CM ( Figure 1A ) . The rotational axes were defined relative to the plane determined by the two proteins' CMs and the Fe atom of Cc with the corresponding Cartesian coordinates ( x0 , y0 , z0 ) , ( x1 , y1 , z1 ) , and ( x2 , y2 , z2 ) ( Equation 6 ) : ( 6 ) Solving the determinant and noticing that one of the CMs is at the origin of the coordinate system , i . e . ( x0 , y0 , z0 ) = ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , gives A\u200a=\u200ay1z2\u2212y2z1 , B\u200a=\u200ax2z1\u2212x1z2 , C\u200a=\u200ax1y2\u2212y1x2 , and D\u200a=\u200a0 . The \u03c7 and \u03be axes are defined along the ( A , B , C ) normal to the plane and the ( x1 , y1 , z1 ) vector joining the two CMs , respectively , while the \u03c6 axis is perpendicular to the latter two and is given by the vector ( A\u2032 , B\u2032 , C\u2032 ) = ( Cy1\u2212Bz1 , Az1\u2212Cx1 , Bx1\u2212Ay1 ) . Two rotational sampling protocols were employed in this work . In the first protocol , the rotational coordinates were systematically varied in \u03b4\u03c7\u200a=\u200a\u03b4\u03c8\u200a=\u200a\u03b4\u03be increments in the full rotational space ( 0\u00b0\u2264\u03c7 , \u03c8<360\u00b0 , 0\u00b0\u2264\u03be<180\u00b0 ) . In the second protocol , the conformational search was performed with composite rotation increments ( \u03b4\u03c7\u200a=\u200a\u03b4\u03c8\u200a=\u200a5\u00b0 , \u03b4\u03be\u200a=\u200a15\u00b0 ) in the reduced rotational space ( \u221245\u00b0\u2264\u03c7 , \u03c8\u226445\u00b0 , 0\u00b0\u2264\u03be<360\u00b0 ) ( Figure 1B , C ) . In the latter case , the Cc in the starting protein-protein orientation was rotated around its CM in \u03b4\u03c7\u200a=\u200a\u03b4\u03c8\u200a=\u200a\u03b4\u03be\u200a=\u200a5\u00b0 increments ( 0\u00b0\u2264\u03c7 , \u03c8<360\u00b0 , 0\u00b0\u2264\u03be<180\u00b0 ) in the search for the position with the smallest separation between the ET cofactors ( black circles in Figure 1B ) . In this way , the frontal orientation of the Cc heme was ensured during subsequent \u03b8 and \u03c6 rotations ( grey circle in Figure 1B ) , enabling sampling of short intermolecular ET distances during the reduced rotational search ( Figure 1C ) . For each rotamer , the intermolecular vdW energy term ( fvdW ) was calculated with a repulsive quartic potential ( Equation 7 ) [33] , [34]: ( 7 ) where rij is the interatomic distance , rmin adopts the values of the standard vdW radii as represented by the Lennard-Jones potential [33] , s is the scaling factor ( the value of 0 . 75 , frequently used in Xplor rigid-body docking [33] , [34] , was employed throughout ) , and kvdW is a force-constant ( 20 kcal\u00b7mol\u22121\u00c5\u22124 ) . The sum is carried over all pairwise intermolecular interactions between the atoms that are below a specified non-bonded cut-off , typically set to a value between 5 . 5 and 8 . 5 \u00c5 . The vdW potential was set to zero for all side-chain atoms extending beyond C\u03b2 , and Cc translated along the vector joining two proteins' CMs until the vdW energy reached the value between zero and a chosen cut-off , thus producing a rigid-body mimic of the protein complex . The separation between the proteins' CMs determines the other translational coordinate , r . In control runs , side-chain optimization with full vdW potential was performed after each translational step ( Figure 2 ) . For each ( \u03c7 , \u03c8 , \u03be ) set , the smallest edge-to-edge distance between the redox cofactors , dmin , was calculated , and the rotamer with the smallest dmin selected . The dmin at each sampled ( \u03b8 , \u03c6 ) position was used in the subsequent distance distribution analysis and the ET-rate calculations . In the Cc-CCO system , the proximity of the CCO residue W104 to the protein surface necessitated side-chain optimization of the final docking solutions . Simulations of ternary complexes were performed by sampling binding geometries of the second Cc molecule disregarding the Cc bound in the 1\u22361 complex and subsequent evaluation of the vdW term between the two Cc molecules . Only the solutions with the vdW terms below a defined cut-off were retained . A similar approach was used for modeling Cc binding to the multidomain proteins Fcb2 and SOX: the interaction of Cc with the Fcb2 or SOX heme domain was followed by evaluation of the overall vdW energies and selection of the allowed solutions . The annotated Xplor-NIH scripts for the conformational sampling are provided in the Dataset S1; their detailed description is given in the Text S1 . The ET rate constants were calculated from Equation 8 [2]: ( 8 ) where k0\u200a=\u200a1013 s\u22121 is the nuclear frequency , \u03b2\u200a=\u200a1 . 4 \u00c5\u22121 is the decay coefficient of the electronic coupling , r is the edge-to-edge distance between the redox centers , r0\u200a=\u200a3 . 6 \u00c5 is the vdW contact distance , \u0394Go is the free energy difference between reactant and product states , \u03bb is the reorganization energy , kB is the Boltzmann constant , and T is the temperature . The values of \u0394Go and \u03bb were taken from the literature ( see Text S2 ) .\nTo define the conformational space available to the interacting molecules and determine the shortest distance between redox cofactors at each sampled point , Cc was used as a probe to explore the surface of a partner protein in search of possible binding geometries . Proteins were treated as rigid bodies with van der Waals ( vdW ) potential set to zero for all atoms extending beyond C\u03b2 to allow partial side-chain overlap , mimicking the uncertainty of the side-chain positions due to local binding-induced reorganization . Steric properties of the generated complexes were assessed by calculating the intermolecular vdW energy term . To determine the optimal parameter set for the conformational search protocol , we performed a number of control runs ( Figure 2 ) . In the first control series ( where only translational freedom of Cc was simulated to accelerate the calculations ) , we examined the choice of the vdW cut-offs ( Figure 2A , B ) . The value of 10 kcal/mol , found to yield realistic mimics of protein complexes in our earlier work [32] , and a more permissive 300 kcal/mol cut-off were assessed . First , we performed a run with the full vdW potential and side-chain optimization for the entire complex at each translation step . The ET distance distribution in this run ( black profile in Figure 2A ) was used as a reference for evaluating the protocols without side-chain optimization and the full vdW potential ( vdW cut-off values of 300 kcal/mol and 10 kcal/mol; red and orange , respectively in Figure 2A , B ) or a reduced vdW term , set to zero for all atoms extending beyond C\u03b2 ( vdW cut-off values 300 kcal/mol and 10 kcal/mol; blue and green , respectively in Figure 2A , B ) . As can be seen in Figure 2A , the red and orange profiles are shifted towards higher r values , indicating that the rigid-body simulations with the full vdW potential produce binding geometries with unrealistically large separations between protein molecules . This is further evidenced by poor correlations between the corresponding distance distributions ( top plots in Figure 2B ) . The runs with the reduced vdW term ( blue and green in Figure 2A ) exhibit profiles highly similar to that of the reference run and feature greatly improved linear trends in the correlation plots ( bottom graphs in Figure 2B ) . In particular , an excellent agreement between the results of the reference run and the computationally faster simulation protocol with the reduced vdW potential and the cut-off value of 10 kcal/mol ( green datasets in Figure 2A , B ) indicates that the latter produces reasonable rigid-body models of protein complexes . Therefore , this protocol was used in all subsequent simulations . Having established the optimal vdW parameters , we proceeded to evaluate the choice of rotational increments to be used in the conformational search protocol . As can be seen in Figure 2C , including Cc rotations around orthogonal axes centered on its CM allows sampling shorter ET distances , with progressively shorter distances accessed at decreasing rotational increments . This is accompanied by a steady increase in the number of rotamers , reaching ca . 187 , 000 per ( \u03b8 , \u03c6 ) position for \u03b4\u03c7\u200a=\u200a\u03b4\u03c8\u200a=\u200a\u03b4\u03be\u200a=\u200a5\u00b0 ( Figure 2D ) . Decreasing the rotational increments further quickly leads to an explosion of structures ( e . g . 1 . 8\u00b71011 structures per run with \u03b4\u03c7\u200a=\u200a\u03b4\u03c8\u200a=\u200a\u03b4\u03be\u200a=\u200a1\u00b0 ) , rendering the computations prohibitively time-consuming . Besides , the number of shorter distances accessed is expected to reach a plateau at smaller increments , making the choice of \u03b4\u03c7\u200a=\u200a\u03b4\u03c8\u200a=\u200a\u03b4\u03be\u200a=\u200a5\u00b0 a good compromise between the density of the rotational space sampling and the computational time invested . Finally , we noticed that in protein-protein complexes with short ET distances , Cc is oriented with its heme group facing the binding partner ( Figure 1B ) . In addition , control runs with the stationary Cc and Cb5 or CcP as the sampling probes showed that the Cc functional epitope maps onto a well-defined patch of the protein surface surrounding the exposed heme edge ( Figures S6 and S7 ) . Based on these observations , we devised an accelerated sampling scheme in a reduced rotational space , consisting of defining the frontal Cc orientation in the starting structure , usual sampling of \u03b8 and \u03c6 dimensions , and the rotational search in a reduced \u03c7 , \u03c8 , \u03be space . As can be seen in Figure 2C ( compare red and black traces ) , the ET distance distributions obtained with the full sampling scheme ( 0\u00b0\u2264\u03c7 , \u03c8<360\u00b0 , 0\u00b0\u2264\u03be<180\u00b0; \u03b4\u03c7\u200a=\u200a\u03b4\u03c8\u200a=\u200a\u03b4\u03be\u200a=\u200a5\u00b0 ) and the reduced rotational search ( \u221245\u00b0\u2264\u03c7 , \u03c8\u226445\u00b0 , 0\u00b0\u2264\u03be<360\u00b0; \u03b4\u03c7\u200a=\u200a\u03b4\u03c8\u200a=\u200a5\u00b0 , \u03b4\u03be\u200a=\u200a15\u00b0 ) are virtually identical . At the same time , confining rotations to a smaller space of \u221230\u00b0\u2264\u03c7 , \u03c8\u226430\u00b0 , 0\u00b0\u2264\u03be<360\u00b0 leads to reduced occurrences of small ET distances , indicating insufficient sampling of the rotational space . Thus , the former protocol \u2013 affording a 24-fold gain in the computational time ( Figure 2D ) \u2013 was used in all subsequent simulations . The conformational search used in this work is not optimized for speed , but rather tailored for a fine sampling of the entire conformational space in the protein complexes . However , significant reduction in the computational time can be achieved by performing the rotational search and outputting the solutions only for the CMs with short separations between the ET cofactors ( e . g . <20 \u00c5 ) . This in effect will discard most of the ET-inactive orientations ( i . e . blue areas in the CM distribution maps in Figures 3\u20136 , see below ) , while sampling the functional epitopes . A further gain in the calculation speed can be achieved by decreasing the resolution of the conformational search , either by increasing the rotational increments or decreasing the spatial resolution , \u03b4d . For instance , setting \u03b4\u03c7 and \u03b4\u03c8 to 15\u00b0 instead of 5\u00b0 and increasing the spacing between the neighboring CMs by 1 \u00c5 afford , respectively , 9- and 4-fold decrease in the number of sampled orientations . Combining the two strategies and restricting the search to the ET-competent areas only ( see above ) are expected to yield a 40- to 60-fold decrease in the computational time , depending on the system . Though the suggested scheme will miss out some of the ET-competent orientations ( thus lowering the accuracy of the upper-limit kET estimates ) , it should still provide robust functional epitope maps . The ET rate constants can be estimated from the distances between redox centers as described by Dutton and co-workers [2] , [35] or calculated from the ET pathway theory developed by Beratan and Onuchic [36] . The latter , computationally more demanding , approach requires the knowledge of the side-chain contacts across the interface , while the former relies solely on the separation between the electron donor and acceptor sites and appears to be more suitable to the rigid-body search method used here . In a broad range of biological systems , the ET rate constants are described by an exponential dependence on the distances between the redox centers ( Equation 8 in the Methods section ) [2] . Being a measure of the electronic coupling between the electron donor and acceptor , the exponential decay constant , \u03b2 , is a property of the medium through which electron tunneling occurs , with the values varying from \u03b2\u200a=\u200a1 . 0 \u00c5\u22121 and \u03b2\u200a=\u200a1 . 3 \u00c5\u22121 for \u03b2-strands and \u03b1-helices , respectively , to \u03b2\u200a=\u200a2 . 8 \u00c5\u22121 for the vacuum [2] , [3] . Analysis of biological ET systems showed that electron tunneling through a protein can be accurately described with a single value of \u03b2\u200a=\u200a1 . 4 \u00c5\u22121 [2] , which is used throughout this work . The functional epitopes of the physiological Cc complexes derived in this work delineate the conformational space available to all ET-competent protein-protein orientations . For the complexes studied , the epitopes map onto the negatively-charged surfaces of the Cc partner proteins . As confirmed by the simulations where the Cc surface is sampled with the Cb5 and CcP molecules ( Figures S6 and S7 ) , Cc maintains frontal orientation in all ET-competent conformations , which is in excellent agreement with the experimental studies showing that the Cc binding interfaces in redox complexes comprise the surface-exposed heme edge and the surrounding ring of lysines ( Figure 7A ) . Taken together , these findings highlight the importance of the electrostatic steering in the ET complexes and confirm that the exposed heme edge serves as the electron exit/entry port in Cc . It is noteworthy that the charge complementarity in Cc complexes is revealed by a method relying solely on steric properties of individual proteins . The fact that most protein-protein orientations with shortest separations between redox cofactors are also highly electrostatically favorable suggests that complementary electrostatics evolved to facilitate intermolecular ET . The fact that the functional epitopes contain multiple , electrostatically favorable , ET-competent binding geometries suggests that in most cases the intermolecular ET can occur from more than one protein-protein orientation and might not require formation of a well-defined , stereospecific complex . Indeed , a recent experimental study of the interactions among a small copper protein amicyanin and several bacterial cytochromes has shown that a highly efficient ET can take place without formation of specific complexes , but rather via loose protein encounters guided by complementary electrostatics [59] . We hypothesize that the Cc ET interactome \u2013 particularly complexes with broad functional epitopes such as those in Cb5 , Fcb2 , SOX , and Erv1 \u2013 can exhibit a similar behavior . It is well known that dynamics regulate the ET within proteins and , together with the fluctuations in the surrounding medium , enable ET gating [60] . Similarly , heterogeneity of the binding geometries in the ET complexes \u2013 arising from multiple protein-protein orientations sampled during the initial , encounter state of the biomolecular association [61] \u2013 is expected to modulate the intermolecular ET rates . Indeed , this notion has been gaining an increasing experimental support . For example , computational analysis of the kinetics data for the interaction of bacterial cytochrome c2 ( Cc2 ) with the photosynthetic reaction centre ( RC ) revealed the presence of multiple ET-active binding geometries explored in the encounter state [62] , [63] . In addition , detailed molecular dynamics simulations of the Cc2-RC encounter complex showed that strong ET coupling pathways between the two proteins include interstitial water molecules and illustrated that structural fluctuations within the encounter ensemble enable fast ET rates , in agreement with the experiment [63] . In another series of studies , Hoffman , Beratan and co-workers showed that interacting Cb5 and myoglobin sample multiple ET-active protein-protein orientations , constituting a subset of the binding geometries explored in the encounter state [19] , [64] . Here , we use the functional epitope mapping to delineate the extent of the conformational space containing all ET-competent geometries , including those populated in the transient encounter complex . The functional epitopes in Cc complexes differ in size and exhibit a large variation in the number of ET-competent binding geometries ( Figure 7B ) . For example , a broad epitope in the Cc-Cb5 complex contains ten times more protein-protein orientations with kET>106 s\u22121 than a narrow , funnel-shaped ET patch in the Cc-Cbc1 complex . Interestingly , the size of the ET epitopes in Cc complexes correlates with the extent of protein dynamics . For instance , being a highly dynamic system consisting of multiple binding geometries [56] , the Cc-Cb5 complex features a broad functional epitope , while the Cc-CcP complex \u2013 where proteins spend 70% of the time in the crystallographic binding orientation and 30% in a loose encounter state [32] , [42] \u2013 has a much narrower ET-competent area . We suggest that the size of the ET epitope can be used as a diagnostic tool to discriminate between highly-dynamic , multiple-orientation complexes ( e . g . Cc-Cb5 , Cc-SOX , Cc-Fcb2 ) and their more static , predominantly single-orientation counterparts ( e . g . Cc-CcP , Cc-CCO , and Cc-Cbc1 ) ( Figure 7B ) . We hypothesize that differences in the widths of the ET-active areas reflect different evolutionary scenarios , contrasting the need to drive Cc binding to a well-defined , single orientation in Cbc1 and CCO complexes ( served to prevent wasteful interactions with other parts of these multisubunit assemblies and the negatively-charged mitochondrial membrane ) and allowing rapid ET from multiple protein-protein orientations in the Cc-Cb5 complex . Without the knowledge of the populations of the protein-protein orientations constituting the functional epitope , the occurrences of donor-acceptor distances and the corresponding ET rates derived in this work cannot be converted into the ET probability distributions , and only the upper-limit kET values can be calculated . It is conceivable that some of the highly ET-competent binding geometries are energetically unfavorable and , therefore , do not form during the interaction . On the other hand , many thermodynamically favorable orientations ( be they ET-active or not ) might never get populated on the protein-protein association path . Thus , accurate predictions of the ET rates from the functional epitopes would require estimating the relative thermodynamic stabilities of the ET-competent binding geometries and addressing the protein association kinetics on a microscopic level . As illustrated by early modeling efforts of the Cc-CcP complex [6] , failure to consider kinetic properties of a system led to an over-optimized predicted binding geometry ( exhibiting high charge complementarity , large number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds , and snug steric fit of the protein sidechains ) , in stark contrast to the crystal structure featuring a single hydrogen bond and a loosely packed interface [37] . Used in the past to investigate Cc interactions with CcP [8] , [65] and Cb5 [9] , [54] , Brownian dynamics ( BD ) simulations afford an effective weighting of various ET-competent orientations and allow extraction of bimolecular rate constants , kon , from association trajectories . When used with the ET reaction criteria ( such as distances between the cofactors or the coupling strengths of ET pathways ) , the BD runs provide estimates for the intermolecular ET rates . Further , combination of BD and molecular dynamics ( MD ) allows to address the roles of structural fluctuations and the intervening solvent in the intermolecular ET process [63] . While BD and BD/MD are clearly methods of choice for accurate ET rate calculations , as a rule they require a complex force-field , adequate definition of the simulation conditions ( e . g . proper partial charge and protonation state assignments for protein sidechains , boundary conditions , etc ) , a certain level of expertise , and considerable amount of time . Interestingly , the functional epitopes of Cc-CcP and Cc-Cb5 complexes delineated with our coarse-grained approach , relying solely on the steric properties of the interacting molecules , are in excellent agreement with those found in BD simulations [8] , [9] , [65] . Thus , it appears that the simple rigid-body conformational search employed in this work is sufficient for an adequate description of the ET-competent areas in Cc complexes . As can be seen from the kET distributions , the studied Cc complexes contain a large number of binding geometries with the ET rates faster than the experimentally measured values . Even though not all of these ET-competent orientations will be populated in a given protein complex ( see above ) , it seems likely that several highly-active conformations will dominate the intermolecular ET . This finding suggests that the overall ET rates in the Cc interactome are not limited by the ET event itself , but rather controlled by alterations in protein dynamics and/or conformational changes , occurring in protein complexes on slower time scales . Such binding-induced and/or redox-dependent conformational changes , reported for free Cc [66] and its complexes with Cbc1 [11] and CCO [67] , could account for the apparent discrepancies between the observed and predicted ET rates . The computational approach used here can be readily extended to other ET systems . Specifically , our analysis does not require the structures of protein complexes; can be applied in combination with homology modeling to systems with unknown protein structure ( s ) ( as exemplified by Cc-Erv1 ) ; allows ensemble treatment of flexible groups ( as shown for Cc complexes with Fcb2 and SOX ) ; permits incorporation of side-chain optimization protocols ( as done in control Cc-Cb5 runs ) ; and enables calculations of the maximal , \u2018activationless\u2019 ET rates for the systems with unknown free energy changes ( \u0394G ) and reorganization energies ( \u03bb ) . We believe that this work will engender future studies of the intermolecular ET in other biological networks .", "output": "**Unlocking the Secrets of Biological Electron Transfer**\n\nBiological electron transfer (ET) is a vital process that occurs in many cellular processes, including photosynthesis and respiration.

{"input": "Forms of presentation of Q fever vary widely across Spain , with differences between the north and south . In the absence of reported case series from Galicia ( north-west Spain ) , this study sought to describe a Q-fever case series in this region for the first time , and conduct a systematic review to analyse all available data on the disease in Spain . Patients with positive serum antibodies to Coxiella burnetii from a single institution over a 5-year period ( January 2011-December 2015 ) were included . Patients with phase II titres above 1/128 ( or documented seroconversion ) and compatible clinical criterial were considered as having Q fever . Patients with clinical suspicion of chronic Q-fever and IgG antibodies to phase I-antigen of over 1/1024 , or persistently high levels six months after treatment were considered to be cases of probable chronic Q-fever . Systematic review: We conducted a search of the Pubmed/Medline database using the terms: Q Fever OR Coxiella burnetii AND Spain . Our search yielded a total of 318 studies: 244 were excluded because they failed to match the main criteria , and 41 were discarded due to methodological problems , incomplete information or duplication . Finally , 33 studies were included . A total of 155 patients , all of them from Galicia , with positive serological determination were located during the study period; 116 ( 75% ) were deemed to be serologically positive patients without Q fever and the remaining 39 ( 25% ) were diagnosed with Q fever . A potential exposure risk was found in 2 patients ( 5% ) . The most frequent form of presentation was pneumonia ( 87% ) , followed by isolated fever ( 5% ) , diarrhoea ( 5% ) and endocarditis ( 3% ) . The main symptoms were headache ( 100% ) , cough ( 77% ) and fever ( 69% ) . A trend to a paucisymptomatic illness was observed in women . Hospital admission was required in 37 cases , and 6 patients died while in hospital . Only 2 patients developed chronic Q-fever . Systematic review: Most cases were sporadic , mainly presented during the winter and spring , as pneumonia in 37% , hepatitis in 31% and isolated fever in 29 . 6% of patients . In the north of Spain , 71% of patients had pneumonia , 13 . 2% isolated fever and 13% hepatitis . In the central and southern areas , isolated fever was the most frequent form of presentation ( 40% ) , followed by hepatitis ( 38 . 4% ) and pneumonia ( 17 . 6% ) . Only 31 . 7% of patients reported risk factors , and an urban-environment was the most frequent place of origin . Overall mortality was 0 . 9% , and the percentage of patients with chronic forms of Q-fever was 2% . This is the first study to report on a Q-fever case series in Galicia . It shows that in this region , the disease affects the elderly population -even in the absence of risk factors- and is linked to a higher mortality than reported by previous studies . While pneumonia is the most frequent form of presentation in the north of the country , isolated fever and hepatitis tend to be more frequent in the central and southern areas . In Spain , 32% of Q-fever cases do not report contact with traditional risk factors , and around 58% live in urban areas .\nQ fever is a zoonosis with a world-wide distribution , caused by Coxiella burnetii , which can present as sporadic cases or through outbreaks in a specific region . Although ticks can play a role as vectors [1] , the usual sources of human infection are cattle , sheep , goats , and wildlife . Since its description , Q fever has been widely studied by many groups , with the 2008 outbreak in the Netherlands increasing interest in the disease in Europe in recent years [2] . The relevance of Q fever in Spain varies widely depending on the region in question , e . g . , whereas large series have been reported in the Basque Country , only a few case reports have come from other regions [3 , 4] . These differences might be due to climatological , social or environmental factors but for the most part , knowledge of the epidemiology of Coxiella burnetii is poor in Spain . To our knowledge there have been no previously reported case series of Q fever in Galicia ( north-west Spain ) , and we only have a limited perspective of the distribution of Coxiella burnetii in animal reservoirs [5] , along with reports of a few isolated cases [6] . Although the presence of cattle is frequent in all areas of Galicia , the existence of an additional wildlife reservoir is also plausible , because populations of foxes , wolves , wild boars and other species also exist in the region . While existing data tend to suggest a difference in clinical presentation between the north and south of the country [7 , 8] , there are nevertheless insufficient data to describe this in Galicia and elsewhere for the purpose of giving a complete picture of Q fever in Spain . Accordingly , the main objectives of this study were: on one hand , to describe a Q-fever case series in Galicia for the first time; and on the other , to conduct a systematic review to clarify and analyse all available data on the disease in Spain .\nA total of 155 patients were located with positive serological determination during the study period; of these , 116 ( 75% ) were deemed to be serologically positive patients without Q fever ( unrelated to an acute or chronic Coxiella burnetii infection ) and the remaining 39 ( 25% ) were diagnosed with Q fever . Regarding the group without Q fever , the indication for serological testing was atypical pneumonia or pneumonia in patients with risk factor for Q fever in 80% of cases , and fever wihtout a clear origin in the remainder . In this second group , main final diagnoses were gastrointenstinal disease , viral infections and neoplasia . All patients included in the group without Q fever had a final diagnosis that excluded Q fever as the cause of their symptoms . Of the Q fever patients , 27 were men ( 69% ) , and only 2 ( 5% ) were found to have a potential risk of exposure ( contact with cattle ) , although this data was available only in 50% of patients . A rural environment was the most frequent place of residence ( 22 patients , 56% ) . None of the patients had reported a tick bite before the appearance of clinical symptoms . A breakdown of the complete epidemiological profile of the series is shown in Table 1 . Most cases were diagnosed during 2015 ( 26 cases , 67% ) and 2014 ( 11 cases , 28% ) , with all presenting in the period from December to June ( winter and spring ) . In terms of clinical manifestations , the most frequent form of presentation was pneumonia ( 35 cases , 90% ) , followed by isolated febrile syndrome ( 2 cases ) , diarrhoea ( 2 cases ) and endocarditis ( 1 case ) . The main symptom reported by patients was headache ( 100% ) , followed by cough ( 77% ) and fever ( 69% ) . It is remarkable that a trend to paucisymptomatic illness was observed in women compared with men . All clinical and analytical aspects are shown in Table 1 . Hospital admission in the Internal Medicine or Pneumology departments was required in all but 2 patients , both of whom successfully underwent ambulatory treatment and follow-up . When it came to empirical treatment , the most frequent regimen included a beta-lactam antibiotic ( 25 patients , 64% ) , either alone ( 8 patients ) or in combination with a fluoroquinolone ( 7 patients ) or a macrolide ( 10 patients ) . After diagnosis of Q fever , 11 patients were switched to doxycycline in monotherapy and another 6 patients to a fluoroquinolone , while the remaining 22 patients completed the initial empirical treatment . There were no differences in patients\u2019 length of hospital stay , duration of symptoms or mortality rates by reference to the treatment received , with the average length of antibiotic therapy being 13 ( SD = 6 ) days . At the date of diagnosis , 28 patients ( 72% ) had phase II titres of over 1/512 . Across follow-up , only 2 patients developed a probable chronic Q fever: one had confirmed endocarditis through transesophageal echocardiogram , and the other had a persistent febrile syndrome which was also judged to be endocarditis , despite it was not possible to perform a complete study due to poor general condition of this patient . Both patients were alive at the end of the study period , and continued undergoing long-term treatment with doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine . Insofar as mortality was concerned , six patients ( 15% ) died , in all cases due to respiratory complications during hospital stay . No epidemiological , clinical or biochemical variable was found to be linked to mortality in our series . This review covered 33 case-series reports ( excluding ours ) spanning a 38-year period ( 1977\u20132014 ) in Spain . Data on a total of 1960 patients ( including our study ) were analysed . A breakdown of the main data available from the studies is shown in Table 2 . It was noteworthy that , when the overall data ( including those of our series ) were analysed , most of the cases were seen to be sporadic , presenting mainly during winter and spring , as pneumonia in 37% , hepatitis in 31% and isolated fever in 29 . 6% of cases . Furthermore , on pooling the case series from areas located in the northern third of the country and comparing these to the remaining series from central and southern Spain , a significant difference was seen in the form of presentation of Q fever . In the northern areas , 71% of patients had pneumonia , followed by isolated fever ( 13 . 2% ) and hepatitis ( 13% ) , while in the central and southern areas isolated fever was the most frequent form of presentation ( 40% ) , followed by hepatitis ( 38 . 4% ) and pneumonia ( 17 . 6% ) . With regard to clinical manifestations , fever was the most frequent ( 94 . 6% ) , followed by headache ( 50 . 2% ) , and myalgia or arthromyalgia ( 33 . 5% ) . Mention should be made of the absence of fever in 108 cases ( 5 . 4% ) , despite diagnosis of Q fever . A risk factor , mainly animal exposure ( in most of cases livestock , but also pets ) , was identified in only 31 . 7% of patients , and urban environment was the most frequent place of origin ( 833/1469 , 58% ) , though these data were missing in 12 studies . Overall mortality was 0 . 9% but the absence of mortality data in 8 studies should be noted . The total percentage of patients with chronic forms of Q fever was 2% , yet it has to be said that no data were reported in 11 studies , and in one study 16 cases were reported as chronic on the basis of serological criteria alone [33] .\nTo the best of our knowledge , this is the first Q fever case-series study to have been conducted in Galicia ( north-west Spain ) , an area that had not been considered endemic until now . Our study shows that the presence of Q fever in this area is relevant , affects the elderly population even in the absence of risk factors , and is linked to a higher mortality than previous studies have indicated . Our systematic review confirms the different presentation of Q fever in northern areas of Spain , where pneumonia is the most frequent form , compared to central and southern areas , where isolated fever and hepatitis are more frequent . This systematic review also shows that nearly 32% of Q fever cases do not report contact with traditional risk factors , and that around 58% of them reside in urban areas . Better knowledge of seroprevalence in different areas and a higher level of clinical suspicion are therefore needed , in order to improve diagnosis and prevention of this disease in Spain .\nA search of the Microbiology Unit database at the Santiago de Compostela University Teaching Hospital ( A Coru\u00f1a , Galicia , Spain ) , covering a 4-year period from January 2011 to December 2015 , located a total of 155 patients . We reviewed the clinical histories of all patients with positive serological determination . In terms of area of residence , \u201curban\u201d was defined as any area having a population of over 50000 , \u201csuburban\u201d as any area having a population of 5000 to 50000 , and \u201crural\u201d as any area having a population of less than 5000 . IgG antibodies to phase I and phase II Coxiella burnetii antigens were determined by indirect immunofluorescence [55 , 56] , according to the manufacturer's instructions ( Vircell , Spain ) . Assayed dilutions began from 1/64 onwards . Seroconversion was considered in all patients with phase-II titres of over 1/128 who had previously been seronegative , or in those who showed a fourfold or greater rise in IgG antibody titre to Coxiella burnetii phase II antigen ( corresponding to 2 dilutions ) [57 , 58] . All titres above 1/128 were deemed to be positive , and we investigated the clinical history of all patients with these serological levels . Clinical , epidemiological , microbiological , radiological and biochemical variables were collected by reviewing patients\u2019 electronic medical records to check for diagnosis of acute Q fever . Inclusion criteria were defined as: positive serological determination; or alternatively , documented seroconversion and clinical diagnosis of acute Q fever , based on compatible signs and symptoms and exclusion of other causes . Patients with a positive serological test but a confirmed aetiology for clinical manifestations other than Q fever were excluded and classified as serologically positive patients without Q fever . Patients with clinical suspicion of chronic Q fever ( cardiac valve disease , prosthetic or bone infection , immunocompromised hosts , or persistent fever of unknown origin ) and IgG antibodies to phase-I antigen of over 1/1024 , or persistently high levels ( over 1/800 ) six months after treatment were considered to be cases of probable chronic Q fever [59] . Patients with criteria for probable chronic Q fever and vegetations in trasesophageal echocardiogram and/or compatible findings after pathological examination of cardiac valves after surgery were considered as Q fever endocarditis [41] . As regards clinical presentation , patients were classified as having: pneumonia , on presentation of radiological consolidation and fever; hepatitis , on presentation of transaminase elevation more than twofold the upper limit of normal; and fever of unknown origin , if they displayed no other clinical , radiological or biochemical alterations . The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Galician Clinical Research Ethics Committee . All data analyzed were anonymized . We conducted a systematic review in order to identify observational studies published before December 2015 , describing Q fever case series in Spain . To this end , we searched the Pubmed/Medline database using the following terms: Q Fever OR Coxiella burnetii AND Spain . In addition , we retrieved additional series by surveying references cited in other reports and using the MEDLINE option , \"Related articles\" . These search methods yielded a total of 318 studies; after a critical perusal of titles and abstracts , 244 were excluded for failing to fulfil the main eligibility criteria ( series reports with a complete clinical description ) . A critical , full-text review of the remaining 74 papers led to a further 41 being discarded because of methodological problems , incomplete clinical information or series duplication . Finally , 33 studies were included in the systematic review . A descriptive analysis was performed , by calculating qualitative-variable rates along with their mean and standard deviation . We used the Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests , as appropriate ( expected frequency value <5 ) , to compare qualitative variables , and the Student's t test for quantitative variables . A P-value <0 . 05 was regarded as significant . All analyses were performed using the SPSS v . 22 . 0 computer software package ( SPSS Inc . , Chicago , IL , USA ) .", "output": "**Understanding Q Fever in Spain: A Study of a Rare Disease**\n\nQ fever is a rare and often misunderstood disease caused by a bacteria called Coxiella burnetii. It can affect people of all ages, but is more common in certain regions of Spain. A recent study has shed new light on the disease in the northwestern region of Galicia, where it was previously unknown.\n\n**The Study**\n\nResearchers at the Santiago de Compostela University Teaching Hospital in Galicia, Spain, conducted a study to identify and analyze cases of Q fever in the region. They reviewed the medical records of 155 patients who had tested positive for Coxiella burnetii antibodies between 2011 and 2015. The study found that 39 of these patients had Q fever, while the remaining 116 had positive antibodies but did not have the disease.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\nThe study revealed that Q fever in Galicia is more common in older adults, even in the absence of risk factors. The disease is also linked to a higher mortality rate than previously thought. The most common symptoms of Q fever are headache, cough, and fever, and pneumonia is the most frequent form of presentation.\n\n**Systematic Review**\n\nThe researchers also conducted a systematic review of existing studies on Q fever in Spain, which included 33 case-series reports spanning a 38-year period. The review found that Q fever cases in northern Spain tend to present with pneumonia, while cases in central and southern Spain are more likely to present with isolated fever and hepatitis.\n\n**Implications**\n\nThe study highlights the need for better knowledge of seroprevalence in different areas and a higher level of clinical suspicion to improve diagnosis and prevention of Q fever in Spain. The researchers also note that nearly 32% of Q fever cases do not report contact with traditional risk factors, and that around 58% of cases reside in urban areas.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nQ fever is a rare and often misunderstood disease that requires further research and awareness. This study provides valuable insights into the disease in Galicia, Spain, and highlights the need for improved diagnosis and prevention strategies. By understanding the epidemiology and clinical presentation of Q fever, healthcare professionals can better identify and treat cases, ultimately saving lives.", "topic": "Q fever", "cat": []}
{"input": "Human African trypanosomiasis ( HAT ) is a neglected tropical disease targeted for elimination \u2018as a public health problem\u2019 by 2020 . The indicators to monitor progress towards the target are based on the number of reported cases , the related areas and populations exposed at various levels of risk , and the coverage of surveillance activities . Based on data provided by the National Sleeping Sickness Control Programmes ( NSSCP ) , Non-Governmental Organizations ( NGOs ) and research institutions\u2014and assembled in the Atlas of HAT\u2014the World Health Organization ( WHO ) provides here an update to 2016 for these indicators , as well as an analysis of the epidemiological situation . Trends for the two primary indicators of elimination are on track for the 2020 goal: 2 , 164 cases of HAT were reported in 2016 ( as compared to the milestone of 4 , 000 cases ) , and for the period 2012\u20132016 280 , 000 km2 are estimated to be at moderate risk or higher ( i . e . \u2265 1 case/10 , 000 people/year ) , as compared to the milestone of 230 , 000 km2 . These figures correspond to reductions of 92% and 61% as compared to the respective baselines ( i . e . 26 , 550 HAT cases in the year 2000 , and 709 , 000 km2 exposed at various levels of risk for the period 2000\u20132004 ) . Among the secondary indicators , an overall improvement in the coverage of at risk populations by surveillance activities was observed . Regarding passive surveillance , the number of fixed health facilities providing gambiense HAT diagnosis or treatment expanded , with 1 , 338 enumerated in endemic countries in 2017 ( +52% as compared to the survey completed only sixteen months earlier ) . Concerning rhodesiense HAT , 124 health facilities currently provide diagnosis or treatment . The broadening of passive surveillance is occurring in a context of fairly stable intensity of active case finding , with between 1 . 8 million and 2 . 4 million people screened per year over the period 2012\u20132016 . Elimination of HAT as a public health problem by 2020 seems within reach , as the epidemiological trends observed in previous years are confirmed in this latest 2016 monitoring update . However , looking beyond 2020 , and in particular to the 2030 goal of elimination of transmission as zero cases for the gambiense form of the disease only , there is no room for complacency . Challenges still abound , including ensuring the effective integration of HAT control activities in the health system , sustaining the commitment of donors and HAT endemic countries , and clarifying the extent of the threat posed by cryptic reservoirs ( e . g . human asymptomatic carriers and the possible animal reservoirs in gambiense HAT epidemiology ) . WHO provides through the network for HAT elimination the essential coordination of the wide range of stakeholders to ensure synergy of efforts .\nSince the beginning of the 21st century , and following the reinforcement of control and surveillance activities against human African trypanosomiasis ( HAT ) , the number of reported cases has been decreasing steadily [1 , 2] . Control activities have been coordinated and implemented by National Sleeping Sickness Control Programmes ( NSSCPs ) with the support of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , in the framework of a longstanding public-private partnership with Sanofi and Bayer , and together with bilateral cooperation , non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) and other stakeholders . In this context , in 2012 WHO included the goal of eliminating sleeping sickness as public health problem by 2020 in its Neglected Tropical Diseases ( NTD ) roadmap [3] . Beyond 2020 , WHO , in coordination with NSSCPs , set the goal of elimination of HAT as interruption of transmission by 2030 ( i . e . reaching and sustaining zero HAT cases ) for the gambiense form of the disease only . Global indicators and milestones were defined to monitor the progress towards elimination , that is presented every two years at WHO HAT stakeholders meetings [4\u20137] . Monitoring updates for 2012 and 2014 have been published [8 , 9] , which indicated that progress towards HAT elimination met the established milestones . The present paper provides a comprehensive review of the progress up to 2016 .\nThe research does not directly involve human participants . No individual data is used in the paper . All the data used are provided routinely by NSSCPs , NGOs and research institutions as epidemiological information and are fully anonymized . As established by a WHO Expert Committee on control and surveillance of HAT [1] , subsequently refined by the WHO HAT elimination Technical Advisory Group ( HAT-e-TAG ) , and finally endorsed by the WHO Neglected Tropical Diseases Scientific and Technical Advisory Group ( NTD-STAG ) , HAT elimination is to be monitored through two primary indicators: ( 1 ) the annual number of reported cases , where the target for the year 2020 is fewer than 2 , 000 cases [1] , and ( 2 ) the area at risk reporting \u2265 1 case/10 , 000 people/year ( calculated over a 5-year period ) , where the target for 2020 ( more exactly , for the 5-year period 2016\u20132020 ) is a reduction of 90% as compared to the 2000\u20132004 baseline [10 , 11] . Three secondary indicators should also be followed: ( a ) the geographic distribution of the disease , ( b ) the population exposed at different levels of risk , and ( c ) the coverage of the exposed populations by control and surveillance activities [1] . The methods used to estimate the global indicators of HAT elimination have already been described in previous biennial updates , most notably for 2012 [8] and 2014 [9] . Additional methodological details are available from more focused publications dealing with HAT geographic distribution [12 , 13] , HAT risk estimation [14 , 15] , HAT cases detected in non-endemic countries [16] , and HAT population at risk potentially covered by fixed health facilities with capacities for HAT diagnosis and treatment [17] . To avoid repetition , in this paper only a few methodological updates are provided . Concerning the number and geographic distribution of HAT cases reported annually , the number of people actively screened for gambiense HAT , as well as the areas and populations at risk of HAT , the present paper provides an update to 2016 . As regards the estimation of the population at risk potentially covered by fixed health facilities with capacities for HAT diagnosis and treatment , a survey of the facilities was carried out between March and June 2017 . Subsequently , a time-distance analysis was performed to estimate their physical accessibility for the at-risk populations [17] . In this exercise , the HAT risk distribution for 2012\u20132016 was used for stratification of results . The present paper includes data from the integrated passive surveillance system , which is being implemented in the context of HAT elimination , mainly in countries and areas where HAT prevalence became very low and systematic active screening is no longer cost-effective . The system turns around sentinel sites , which are selected following epidemiological criteria . Based on their respective capacities , sentinel sites perform different levels of diagnosis ( clinical suspicion , serological suspicion and parasitological confirmation ) on patients attending the facilities for any health problem . The HAT surveillance activity is fully integrated in the activities of the centres . Capacities for HAT diagnosis in these centres are upgraded through training , provision equipment and materials and supervision . Data are routinely collected and periodically analysed . Each HAT case detected triggers a response consisting of an active screening campaign ( i . e . reactive screening ) in the community of origin of the affected patient . All data used in this epidemiological update are assembled in the Atlas of HAT [13] , and they have been provided by the NSSCPs , as well as by NGOs and research institutions .\nThe decreasing trend observed for this indicator in previous years has continued . In 2015 , a total of 2 , 801 new HAT cases were reported and in 2016 the figure went down to 2 , 164 , including both gambiense and rhodesiense HAT ( Fig 1 ) . Such record low figures are 1 , 699 and 1 , 836 cases below the respective milestones as set in the WHO roadmap . Details on the HAT cases reported by country and by year ( period 2000\u20132016 ) are shown in Table 1 ( T . b . gambiense ) and Table 2 ( T . b . rhodesiense ) . Most of the reported cases correspond to gambiense HAT , with 2 , 729 and 2 , 110 cases in 2015 and 2016 respectively\u2014the 2016 figure corresponding to a 92% reduction compared to 2000 . The heaviest burden of gambiense HAT continues to be carried by the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) , which in 2016 accounted for 1 , 768 cases ( 84% of the gambiense HAT burden ) . Active case finding has been one of the major tools to combat T . b . gambiense transmission . The number of people actively screened in the period 2000\u20132016 is presented in Fig 2 . Despite year-to-year variations , the overall intensity of active case finding has been fairly stable over the described time period , and it has varied between 1 . 8 million and 2 . 4 million people screened per year over the last five-year period ( 2012\u20132016 ) . However , whereas in the year 2000 one HAT case was detected for every 152 people actively screened ( 13 , 400 cases actively detected / 2 . 039 , 254 people screened ) , in 2016 1 , 981 people needed to be screened per each case actively detected ( 1 , 208 cases actively detected / 2 , 355 , 885 people screened ) . In addition to active screening , it is worth noting that the number of cases passively detected correspond to 49% of the gambiense HAT cases reported from 2000 , varying from 39 . 5% in 2000 to 44% in 2016 , with a maximum of 59% in 2007 . Fig 3A shows the geographic distribution of sleeping sickness cases for the 5-year period 2012\u20132016 . The locations of active screening activities where no cases were detected are included ( green dots ) . For the period 2012\u20132016 , 22 , 281 new HAT cases were reported , 87 . 3% of which could be mapped at the village level . For the remaining 12 . 7% of the cases , village-level mapping was not possible and mapping was done at the district or sub-district level . For the whole period 2000\u20132016 ( 2000 being the start year of the Atlas of HAT ) , a total number of 211 , 539 cases has been included in the database . Of these , 93 . 2% cases have been mapped at the village level , for a total of 31 , 115 mapped villages . The average accuracy for mapped HAT cases is presently estimated at 1 . 4 km , and it is being continuously improved .\nData for the biennium 2015\u20132016 show that the epidemiological situation of HAT is following the trends observed in previous years ( 2000\u20132014 ) , thus indicating further progress towards the goal of elimination of HAT as a public health problem by 2020 . The number of cases reported has decreased by 92% since the year 2000 ( from 26 , 550 to 2 , 164 ) . The area reporting \u2265 1 case/10 , 000 inhabitants/year in the five-year period ( 2012\u20132016 ) has shrunk by 61% from the baseline period ( 2000\u20132004 ) . Concerning gambiense HAT , the decrease in the number of cases and in the area reporting \u2265 1 case/10 , 000 inhabitants/year is observed in a context of sustained active screening and reinforced passive surveillance in the majority of endemic countries . Importantly , the number of health facilities providing gambiense HAT diagnosis and treatment keeps increasing , and so does their potential coverage of the at-risk population . Therefore , it can be considered that the observed trends are very likely to reflect a real abatement in disease transmission , despite the challenges always posed by under-detection . Despite the very encouraging global picture painted by the global indicators , the situation is not homogeneous , as gambiense HAT control and surveillance has weakened in a few countries , mainly owing to security constraints ( e . g . Central African Republic and South Sudan ) . In addition , if the awareness of the disease wanes and there is an insufficient country ownership of the elimination process and goals , there could be a risk of deceleration of control and surveillance activities . The consequences of such deceleration have already been painfully experienced in the recent history of HAT . Looking at the rhodesiense form of the disease , which continues to represent a small proportion of the total number of HAT reported cases , the decreasing trend seems to be sustained , with a further reduction in the number of cases ( 92% from 2000 to 2016 , from 709 cases to 54 ) , and the corresponding dwindling of the area at risk . Nevertheless , these reported trends are likely to be less representative of the real situation than those for gambiense HAT . In particular , disease surveillance has weakened in such countries as Tanzania , Uganda ( for rhodesiense HAT ) , Zambia and Zimbabwe . The widespread adoption of serological rapid tests to diagnose malaria , which have replaced microscopic examination , now prevents the accidental diagnosis of rhodesiense HAT when testing for malaria . The problem is exacerbated by a concomitant decrease in HAT-skilled staff who could maintain knowledge and awareness of the disease . These factors , compounded by the acute clinical progression of rhodesiense HAT usually prevalent in remote rural areas , are likely to result in non-negligible under-detection . An indirect indication of this possible under-detection is the fact that 8 cases ( 6% of the total rhodesiense HAT caseload ) were diagnosed in non-endemic countries among returning tourists in 2015\u20132016 .\nProgress in the indicators to monitor HAT elimination , backed by the Atlas of HAT , shows a robust and sustained trend towards the 2020 goal ( i . e . elimination as public health problem ) , which appears well within reach . The positive epidemiological trend primarily owes to the efforts of NSSCP , supported by WHO and a range of committed stakeholders . To ensure the sustainability of these gains , and to pave the way for further progress , this support must be maintained . In this context , ownership of the elimination process and targets by endemic countries has to be reinforced , the development of improved tools has to continue , the availability of diagnostic tools must be ensured and WHO coordination of countries and other stakeholders must be ensured to maximize synergies . To this end , the WHO network for HAT elimination has been set up as the backbone for coordination and to facilitate the implementation of new tools and strategies . At this critical juncture in the process of elimination , the main challenge is to set up a cost-effective , adapted and sustained HAT control and surveillance strategies . This requires the progressive integration of HAT control activities in the general health system , which is often particularly difficult in those peripheral rural areas where the disease is more entrenched and the health system is weak . The sustainable elimination of HAT requires the reinforcement of the peripheral health system , a duty that falls beyond the HAT programmes and should be part of the Universal Health Coverage goal . Whilst further decreasing the gambiense HAT burden seems possible , it will be important not to neglect the rhodesiense form , despite its relatively low number of cases . Unfortunately , as opposed to gambiense HAT , very few innovative tools have been developed for rhodesiense HAT screening , diagnosis and treatment . However , it is noteworthy that a clinical trial for the use of fexinidazole in rhodesiense HAT is now in preparation stage . The zoonotic nature of rhodesiense HAT does not presently allow to envisage the interruption of its transmission , whilst for the gambiense form , zero transmission increasingly appears as an attainable target . Based on the data presented in this paper , and taking into account the epidemiological situation by country , the elimination of HAT as public health problem could be considered as already achieved in a number of HAT endemic countries . The criteria to assess and validate this status have been developed by WHO to enable the claim by countries and the formal recognition by WHO . Beyond the elimination of HAT as public health problem , there is a pressing need to develop the strategies and intensify selected interventions towards the following target , the elimination as interruption of HAT transmission ( zero cases ) for the gambiense form of the disease . In this prospective scenario , adapted and cost-effective strategies are bound to rely more heavily on disease surveillance , and the sustained commitment of donors will be crucial . Also , clarifying the epidemiological role played by human asymptomatic carriers , by parasites in the skin , and by the possible animal reservoirs in gambiense HAT epidemiology , will be essential , as they may pose a threat to the full interruption of transmission , and to avert its resurgence or reintroduction [24 , 25] .", "output": "**Progress Towards Eliminating Sleeping Sickness in Africa**\n\nSleeping sickness, also known as Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), is a deadly disease that affects millions of people in Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set a goal to eliminate HAT as a public health problem by 2020, and a new report provides an update on the progress made towards this goal.\n\n**Background**\n\nHAT is a neglected tropical disease that is caused by a parasite transmitted by tsetse flies. It is a major public health problem in Africa, particularly in rural areas where access to healthcare is limited. The disease is characterized by symptoms such as fever, headache, and swelling of the lymph nodes, and if left untreated, it can lead to death.\n\n**Methods**\n\nThe report is based on data collected from National Sleeping Sickness Control Programmes (NSSCPs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and research institutions. The data was analyzed to track the progress towards the goal of eliminating HAT as a public health problem by 2020.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\nThe report shows that the number of HAT cases reported in 2016 was 2,164, which is a significant reduction from the 26,550 cases reported in 2000. The area at risk of HAT has also decreased by 61% since 2000. The report also highlights the importance of active case finding, which has been a major tool in combating HAT transmission.\n\n**Significance**\n\nThe report provides a positive update on the progress made towards eliminating HAT as a public health problem by 2020. The decreasing trend in HAT cases and the area at risk suggests that the efforts of NSSCPs, supported by WHO and other stakeholders, are paying off. However, the report also highlights the challenges that still need to be addressed, such as the need for sustained commitment from donors and endemic countries, and the development of improved tools for diagnosis and treatment.\n\n**Future Directions**\n\nThe report emphasizes the need for continued efforts to eliminate HAT as a public health problem by 2020, and to develop strategies for the elimination of HAT transmission (zero cases) for the gambiense form of the disease. The report also highlights the importance of clarifying the epidemiological role played by human asymptomatic carriers, parasites in the skin, and possible animal reservoirs in gambiense HAT epidemiology.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe report provides a positive update on the progress made towards eliminating HAT as a public health problem by 2020. However, it also highlights the challenges that still need to be addressed. Continued efforts are needed to sustain the progress made and to develop strategies for the elimination of HAT transmission (zero cases) for the gambiense form of the disease.", "topic": "Human African Trypanosomiasis", "cat": []}
{"input": "The skin is a highly regenerative organ which plays critical roles in protecting the body and sensing its environment . Consequently , morbidity and mortality associated with skin defects represent a significant health issue . To identify genes important in skin development and homeostasis , we have applied a high throughput , multi-parameter phenotype screen to the conditional targeted mutant mice generated by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute's Mouse Genetics Project ( Sanger-MGP ) . A total of 562 different mouse lines were subjected to a variety of tests assessing cutaneous expression , macroscopic clinical disease , histological change , hair follicle cycling , and aberrant marker expression . Cutaneous lesions were associated with mutations in 23 different genes . Many of these were not previously associated with skin disease in the organ ( Mysm1 , Vangl1 , Trpc4ap , Nom1 , Sparc , Farp2 , and Prkab1 ) , while others were ascribed new cutaneous functions on the basis of the screening approach ( Krt76 , Lrig1 , Myo5a , Nsun2 , and Nf1 ) . The integration of these skin specific screening protocols into the Sanger-MGP primary phenotyping pipelines marks the largest reported reverse genetic screen undertaken in any organ and defines approaches to maximise the productivity of future projects of this nature , while flagging genes for further characterisation .\nRecent advances in the high throughput production of targeted mutant mice using gene targeting in ES cells have made it possible to rapidly and effectively produce knockout mouse lines for use in phenotypic screening [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] . Such approaches are now beginning to yield significant insights into mammalian gene function [1] , [5] . Central to recent community efforts has been the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute's Mouse Genetics Project ( Sanger-MGP ) , which is undertaking a high throughput reverse genetic screen using the knockout ES cells generated by the International Knockout Mouse Consortium , which has now merged with the International Phenotyping Mouse Consortium ( www . mousephenotype . org ) . To maximise the value of this resource , it is important to develop organ specific secondary screens to complement the broad phenotyping efforts applied in existing production pipelines . To this end , we implemented a multi-parameter , multi-test skin screen to identify mouse models of skin dysfunction and to elucidate genetic pathways important for skin development and function . In this study , we detail the skin assessment pipelines internal to the Sanger-MGP as well as skin analyses performed externally , with the exception of the fluorescent tail whole mount analysis , published elsewhere [6] . A flowchart for the pipeline is summarised in Figure 1A and presented in more detail in Figure S1A . The skin is the largest of the intermediate sized organs in the human body [7] and it plays integral roles in immune surveillance , wound healing and protection from environmental challenge [8] . Skin related conditions account for significant health expenditure and top the list of reasons for general practice appointments in the U . S . [9] . A considerable number of skin conditions have genetic underpinnings [10] . Therefore , understanding the genetic basis of skin development and skin disorders has the potential to greatly impact both the diagnosis and treatment of skin related conditions . Moreover , a significant number of other systemic diseases or those principally affecting other organs also manifest themselves in the skin . Such conditions include diabetes mellitus , chronic kidney disease , celiac disease , and rheumatoid arthritis . As a highly regenerative organ in which developmental gene expression is often recapitulated during adulthood , the skin also provides a window into many of the programs central to differentiation and homeostasis . The skin and its associated \u201cmini organ\u201d , the hair follicle , are particularly attractive targets for such a screen because of their ready accessibility and dynamic nature [11] . Furthermore , the clinical pathology and physiology based mouse phenotyping \u201cpipelines\u201d are not designed to find subtle lesions affecting the skin [12] . For these reasons a skin specific phenotyping program was implemented on the genetically modified mice produced by the Sanger-MGP with a goal of defining new and previously unappreciated genetic determinants of skin disease . In this paper mouse lines carrying mutations in each of 562 genes were investigated , and phenotypes were identified as a result of mutations in 23 genes ( Table S1 ) . These skin studies have identified genes not previously associated with skin phenotypes and ascribe further functions to genes which were previously associated with skin disease . We also used these tests to assign 25 Mammalian Phenotype ( MP ) ontology terms [13] ( http://www . informatics . jax . org/searches/MP_form . shtml ) , 2 of which are novel ( Table S1 ) . The scale of the screen also provides the opportunity to assess the relative value of different phenotyping approaches , with a view to implementing these screens in other proposed and ongoing high throughput reverse genetic screens .\nA number of the screens identified new players in cutaneous biology or identified new phenotypes not previously associated with these genes . Some individual examples are discussed . A critical question for any screening approach is the relative value it brings in respect of identifying new phenotypes . While all parts of the skin screen identified mutant lines that were also identified in other tests , there were still sets of genes that were unique to each specific test ( Figure 5A ) . For example , three out of the five genes identified in the hair follicle cycling screens were not identified using any other screening approach in our skin phenotyping pipeline ( Figure 5A ) . This is also particularly true of the histopathology screen in which 11 of the 14 positive genotypes recorded no other hits in other skin pipeline \u2013 although the depth of screening by this approach was limited to 1\u20132 mice per line ( Figure 5A ) . We also noted that each test identified MP terms that were not described by any other tests ( Figure 5B ) . That is to say , the addition of extra screens for subtle phenotypes that were not reflected in gross changes to appearance were reliably able to identify both new genes and new phenotypes ( Figure 5A , B , C; Table S1 ) . Taken together this strongly argues for the inclusion of these more involved screens to flag skin related abnormalities , particularly in light of the relatively low hit rates achieved using simple dysmorphology . The screen in its current form may also underestimate the frequency of abnormal phenotypes due to the limitations imposed by sample size , albinism in strains , the stage of the hair cycle the necropsy samples , and a consequence of homozygous embryonic lethality . More detailed screens employing larger numbers of mice , together with skin-specific conditional sub-strains to overcome problems of complete knock-out lethality , will be required to accurately define a greater number and range of phenotypes . We detail one of the most comprehensive reverse genetic skin screens yet reported in mice . The gene targeting strategy , combined with a robust skin phenotyping protocol , has allowed immediate establishment of a preliminary connection between a genotype and a phenotype . Such approaches have only become feasible through the recent advent of high throughput , targeted mouse mutagenesis screens . Clearly , more detailed follow-up studies are necessary to elaborate on these initial findings and to investigate in greater detail the contribution of a given gene to the biology of the skin . One such follow-up study on Krt76 is provided in an accompanying manuscript in this issue of PLoS Genetics [16] . Nonetheless high throughput approaches of this type will be central to flagging genes for further study . An argument might be made that molecules important to something as visually evident as skin development and homeostasis would already have been identified through mutagenesis approaches , or historically as a result of sporadically occurring mutations . However , the identification of two new genes that cause defects in pigmentation ( Mysm1 and Vangl1 ) and a further additional pigmentation phenotype in Myo5a mutants shows that even for the most obvious cutaneous feature , there remains considerable value in ongoing screening for new causative mutations . In particular , clinical and histological presentations vary between alleles based on the type of mutation ( null , hypomorph ) or inbred strain background ( strain specific modifier genes ) , and so comparison between these \u201cknockout ready\u201d targeted mouse lines and existing spontaneous mutants present in various public repositories will be particularly informative in respect of gene function . Similarly the skin might be considered an \u201ceasy\u201d target for phenotypic screens , and that important genes could simply be identified based on a casual observation of the mutant animal in question . Our results argue that this is not the case . Instead we find that there is significant value in including secondary , organ specific screens in large scale projects of this nature . In deciding which phenotypic screens to apply to a given mutant mouse population one has to consider the likelihood that a given test will identify a phenotype not also apparent in other primary phenotyping screens . The object of such an assessment is therefore to reduce the costs and processes associated in examining such large cohorts of mice , whilst maximising the value of the resource ( i . e . in robust phenotypes flagged ) . Interestingly , based on our experience , each of the phenotypic screens utilised added significantly to the base level of hits in the screen ( Figure 5 ) . While gross skin abnormality assessments shared the greatest overlap with the other screens employed , there were considerable numbers of genes identified in the more subtle screens that did not result in an obvious , visually assessable , phenotype in the mouse . The hair follicle cycling screen is a case in point . To all intents and purposes the visual phenotype of those animals which display abnormal hair follicle cycling is normal . However , a simple estimation of cycling stage uncovered a further class of mutants whose involvement in this process was never previously appreciated . The same is true of the section based histopathology screen , which was able to identify subtle but potentially valuable phenotypes . In both cases , whether through the subtle temporal regulation of follicle cycling or via the cellular diversity assessed in the pathology screen , looking a little deeper , can be a particularly valuable exercise . Taken together , our screen has identified a diverse collection of genes which will form the basis of further studies aimed at elucidating gene function in more detail . They also highlight the value of including detailed skin phenotyping approaches in any future efforts of this nature .\nAll mouse studies were undertaken by Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Mouse Genetics Project as part of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium and licensed by the UK Home Office in accordance with the Animals ( Scientific Procedures ) Act 1986 . Animal models maintained under the auspices of ethics applications to Monash University were subject to the conditions of the Australian Bureau of Animal Welfare . Mice were generated from ES cells in the KOMP/EUCOMM pipeline and principally compromised conditional ready alleles in which a lacZ reporter cassette was integrated upstream of a floxed essential exon [5] ( Figure S2 ) . With a few exceptions ( n\u200a=\u200a24/532 ) the mice were generated from C57BL/6N ES cells and maintained on this genetic background . A proportion of the lines examined ( n\u200a=\u200a201 ) , generally those that entered the pipeline in the initial stages of the project , were maintained on a mixed C57BL/6N;C57BL/6Brd-Tyrc-Brd background . For mice in the histopathology screen details of the strain background , age of sampling , diet , sex , time of tissue harvest , allele name and heterozygosity/homozygosity are detailed in Table S1 . Animals were maintained in a specific pathogen free environment with ad libitum access to food ( typically Mouse Breeders Diet ( LabDiets 5021-3 , IPS , Richmond , USA ) ) and water . Specific details of housing and husbandry for individual lines are available from mouseinterest@sanger . ac . uk . For some lines ( indicated in Table S1 ) mice at 4 weeks of age were transferred to a high fat ( 21 . 4% fat by crude content; 42% calories provided by fat ) dietary challenge ( Special Diet Services Western RD 829100 , SDS , Witham , UK ) . All mice generated by the Sanger-MGP underwent a broad primary phenotype screen ( \u201cdysmorphology screen\u201d; see Table S1 , ) , which included the visual assessment of skin and hair as described here . Tail skin ( n\u200a=\u200a2 ) was collected at necropsy for whole mount immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) analysis using antibodies against keratins ( KRT ) 15 and 14 ( as per [52] [6] ) . The activity of the integrated beta-galactosidase ( lacZ ) cassette was assessed using heterozygous cohorts of mice ( n\u200a=\u200a2 male , 2 female ) generated specifically for expression analysis . The pattern of \u03b2-gal reporter gene activity was determined by lacZ labelling of whole mount tissue preparations from heterozygous knockout . Mice were perfused with fresh cold 4% paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) . Tissues were fixed for a further 30 min in 4% PFA , rinsed in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and labelled with 0 . 1% X-gal for 48 hours at 4\u00b0C . Samples were post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C , cleared with 50% glycerol , transferred to 70% glycerol and imaged . Dorsal skin at the thoraco-lumbar region/interscapular region was collected at the time of necropsy , fixed in neutral buffered 10% formalin solution , process routinely , embedded in paraffin , sectioned at 6 \u00b5m , stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( H&E ) . Samples from 1\u20132 female animals were reviewed by an experienced , board certified veterinary anatomic pathologist ( JPS ) . Animals intended for histopathology were reserved for this purpose and not subjected to other phenotyping tests . All slides were scanned and images archived using Zeiss Mirax Slide Scanner and associated software . In addition , representative photomicrographs were taken of all H&E stained slides . Images are available immediately through the Dryad online database ( doi:10 . 5061/dryad . mv34v ) and progressively through the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium website ( www . mousephenotype . org ) and on the Mouse Genome Informatics webpage ( http://www . informatics . jax . org/genes . shtml ) ( also see Table S1 ) .", "output": "**Unlocking the Secrets of Skin Regeneration: A Groundbreaking Study**\n\nThe skin is our body's first line of defense against the outside world, playing a vital role in protecting us from harm and sensing our environment. However, skin defects and disorders can have severe consequences, making it a significant health issue. To better understand the genetic basis of skin development and disease, researchers have conducted a comprehensive study using a high-throughput, multi-parameter phenotype screen on mice.\n\n**The Study's Goal**\n\nThe researchers aimed to identify genes important in skin development and homeostasis by applying a robust skin phenotyping protocol to a large cohort of genetically modified mice. They used a cutting-edge approach, combining gene targeting with a robust skin phenotyping protocol, to establish a preliminary connection between a genotype and a phenotype.\n\n**The Findings**\n\nThe study identified 23 genes associated with skin lesions, many of which were not previously linked to skin disease. These genes included Mysm1, Vangl1, Trpc4ap, Nom1, Sparc, Farp2, and Prkab1, which were not previously associated with skin disease. The study also ascribed new cutaneous functions to genes such as Krt76, Lrig1, Myo5a, Nsun2, and Nf1.\n\n**The Significance**\n\nThis study highlights the importance of including secondary, organ-specific screens in large-scale projects to identify new genes and phenotypes. The researchers found that each test added significantly to the base level of hits in the screen, and that subtle screens, such as the hair follicle cycling screen and the section-based histopathology screen, were particularly valuable in identifying new genes and phenotypes.\n\n**The Implications**\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of skin development and disease. The identification of new genes and phenotypes associated with skin disease will help researchers develop new treatments and therapies for skin-related conditions. Additionally, the study's approach can be applied to other organs and systems, providing a valuable tool for understanding the genetic basis of complex diseases.\n\n**The Future Directions**\n\nThe study's authors suggest that more detailed follow-up studies are necessary to elaborate on the initial findings and investigate the contribution of each gene to the biology of the skin. They also propose that the approach used in this study can be applied to other organs and systems, providing a valuable tool for understanding the genetic basis of complex diseases.\n\nIn conclusion, this groundbreaking study has shed new light on the genetic basis of skin development and disease, highlighting the importance of including secondary, organ-specific screens in large-scale projects.

{"input": "Epilepsy is common in developing countries , and it is often associated with parasitic infections . We investigated the relationship between exposure to parasitic infections , particularly multiple infections and active convulsive epilepsy ( ACE ) , in five sites across sub-Saharan Africa . A case-control design that matched on age and location was used . Blood samples were collected from 986 prevalent cases and 1 , 313 age-matched community controls and tested for presence of antibodies to Onchocerca volvulus , Toxocara canis , Toxoplasma gondii , Plasmodium falciparum , Taenia solium and HIV . Exposure ( seropositivity ) to Onchocerca volvulus ( OR\u200a=\u200a1 . 98; 95%CI: 1 . 52\u20132 . 58 , p<0 . 001 ) , Toxocara canis ( OR\u200a=\u200a1 . 52; 95%CI: 1 . 23\u20131 . 87 , p<0 . 001 ) , Toxoplasma gondii ( OR\u200a=\u200a1 . 28; 95%CI: 1 . 04\u20131 . 56 , p\u200a=\u200a0 . 018 ) and higher antibody levels ( top tertile ) to Toxocara canis ( OR\u200a=\u200a1 . 70; 95%CI: 1 . 30\u20132 . 24 , p<0 . 001 ) were associated with an increased prevalence of ACE . Exposure to multiple infections was common ( 73 . 8% of cases and 65 . 5% of controls had been exposed to two or more infections ) , and for T . gondii and O . volvulus co-infection , their combined effect on the prevalence of ACE , as determined by the relative excess risk due to interaction ( RERI ) , was more than additive ( T . gondii and O . volvulus , RERI\u200a=\u200a1 . 19 ) . The prevalence of T . solium antibodies was low ( 2 . 8% of cases and 2 . 2% of controls ) and was not associated with ACE in the study areas . This study investigates how the degree of exposure to parasites and multiple parasitic infections are associated with ACE and may explain conflicting results obtained when only seropositivity is considered . The findings from this study should be further validated .\nThe prevalence of epilepsy in low and middle-income countries is higher than in high-income countries , especially in the rural areas[1] , [2] . The prevalence is particularly high in sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) [3] and South America[4] , where parasitic infestations are thought to contribute to the increased burden[5] . Within these regions , there are areas in which most of the population are exposed to endemic parasites , and it is not clear why some people develop epilepsy , whilst others do not . Many factors are associated with epilepsy in SSA[3] , [6] with infections that involve the central nervous system ( CNS ) representing common and preventable causes of epilepsy[5] . Some parasitic infestations manifest in the human CNS , with the clinical presentation of seizures and are thought to be associated with the development of epilepsy[5] , [7] . A small number of studies conducted in SSA have shown that exposure to helminths , e . g . , Toxocara canis[8] , [9] , [10] , Onchocerca volvulus [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] and Taenia solium [10] , [14] , as well as following severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria[15] , [16] are associated with epilepsy . The relationship between Toxoplasma gondii and epilepsy has only been explored in one study in SSA[10] , and a review suggests a possible association[17] , though co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus may confound this relationship . Seizures are observed in HIV-infected individuals and are mainly associated with opportunistic infections although HIV infection can independently cause seizures at seroconversion or at advanced stages[18] . A comprehensive analysis of exposure to parasitic infestations as well as HIV using the same methodology across different geographical locations in SSA would help elucidate the relationship between parasitic infections and epilepsy , and provide data to guide public health measures . The objective of the current study was to investigate the association between active convulsive epilepsy ( ACE ) and i ) the degree of exposure to parasitic infections ( measured by antibody levels ) and ii ) exposure to multiple co-incidental parasitic infections . We used data from a case-control study conducted in five health and demographic surveillance systems ( HDSS ) in SSA in which exposure to the six infections namely: O . volvulus , T . solium , T . canis , T . gondii , P . falciparum and HIV , was determined by serology .\nAll aspects of the study were approved by the ethics committees of University College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , and by the ethics review boards in each of the participating countries . All participants or guardians gave written informed consent . Since some study participants were minors , parents/guardians provided consent on behalf of all child participants and all adults provided consent for themselves . A case control design was used in which prevalent cases of ACE were compared to community controls . ACE was defined as two or more unprovoked convulsions ( seizures with tonic and/or clonic movements ) occurring at least 24 hours apart with at least one seizure in the preceding 12 months[6] . The diagnosis for ACE was initially made by a clinician with special training in epilepsy , and was confirmed by a panel of neurologists . Cases and controls were identified from five HDSS in SSA ( Agincourt in South Africa , Kilifi in Kenya , Kintampo in Ghana , Ifakara in Tanzania and Iganga-Mayuge in Uganda ) . Exposure to parasitic infections was measured using plasma samples collected from a random subsample of all cases and controls . A sample size of 300 cases per site with an equal number of controls was chosen to give 80% power to detect an odds ratio ( OR ) >2 . 8 ( 5% significance level ) given a frequency of at least 5% in the controls . For each case , an age-matched control was selected at random from a database of individuals in the HDSS . The controls were frequency matched using the age bands 0\u20135 , 6\u201312 , 13\u201318 , 19\u201328 , 29\u201349 , 50+ years , to account for increasing exposure with age . Exposure to infections was determined by detection of IgG antibodies to the parasitic antigens as well as HIV . Exposure to O . volvulus and T . solium was determined in three study sites: Iganga , Ifakara and Kintampo , where these parasites are endemic . Logistic regression was used to model the association between antibody titre and ACE . Antibody titre was categorised into tertiles , which were calculated separately for each study site . The model also included , as potential confounders: age ( 0\u20135 , 6\u201312 , 13\u201318 , 19\u201328 , 29\u201349 , 50+ years ) , sex , study-site , education ( none , primary , or secondary and above ) , employment and marital status . Logistic regression was also used to model exposure to multiple infections . We used adjusted odds ratios obtained from logistic regression to test for an additive interaction between parasites by calculating the relative excess risk due to interaction ( RERI ) . The analysis of interactions was restricted to those parasites where the association with epilepsy was statistically significant ( p<0 . 05 ) . We briefly outline the relation between RERI and interaction on an additive scale . Under an additive model the following relation holdswhere and correspond to the prevalence when both or neither parasite risk factor is present , and and represent the prevalence when one of the risk factors is present . An interaction on an additive scale can be quantified as the difference between and . If this difference is positive then the combined effect of the two parasites is more than the sum of their individual effects . Conversely , if the difference is negative then the combined effect is less than the sum of the individual effects . The RERI is obtained by dividing the difference by Again a positive RERI represents a combined effect that is greater than that predicted by the additive model and a negative RERI occurs when the combined effect that is less than additive . We use odds ratios obtained from logistic regression to approximate prevalence ratios in the above formula; this approximation is expected to work well since epilepsy is rare in the study population[25] . No adjustment for multiple comparisons was made because this adjustment can lead to errors of interpretation when strong previous evidence of association is available for several risk factors [26] . All analyses were conducted using STATA version 12 ( StataCorp . College Station , TX , USA ) .\n2 , 032 controls and 1 , 711 cases were recruited . The sensitivity of the three-stage survey method was 48 . 6%[27] , and among controls the rate of refusal ranged between 49 . 8% in Agincourt to 57 . 4% in Kilifi[10] . Blood samples were collected from 986 cases of ACE and 1 , 313 controls . The number of blood samples tested for each parasite were as follows: O . volvulus , 535 cases and 836 controls; T . canis , 862 cases and 1 , 121 controls; T . gondii 971 cases and 1 , 291 controls; P . falciparum , 986 cases and 1 , 313 controls; HIV , 977 cases and 1 , 304 controls; T . solium , 530 cases and 833 controls . The demographic details of the cases and controls from each study site are shown in Table S1 . The prevalence of antibodies to the six infections studied varied between the five study sites ( Table 1 ) . The prevalence of antibodies increased with age in both cases and controls for O . volvulus , T . canis , T . gondii and P . falciparum ( Figure S1\u2013S3 , respectively ) and these trends were consistent in all study sites . Almost all study participants were P . falciparum positive in three sites ( Figure S4 ) . Antibody prevalence to T . solium was low in the three study sites analysed ( Table 1 ) and showed no trend with age ( Figure S5 ) . Similarly , antibody prevalence to HIV showed no trend with age ( Figure S6 ) . The association between seropositivity and ACE , varied between different exposures and study sites ( Table 1 ) . Significant associations with ACE include exposure to O . volvulus in all study sites ( OR\u200a=\u200a1 . 98; 95%CI: 1 . 52\u20132 . 58 , p<0 . 001 ) , Ifakara ( OR\u200a=\u200a1 . 52; 95%CI: 1 . 06\u20132 . 19 , p\u200a=\u200a0 . 023 ) , Iganga-Mayuge ( OR\u200a=\u200a2 . 89; 95%CI: 1 . 08\u20137 . 69 , p\u200a=\u200a0 . 034 ) and Kintampo ( OR\u200a=\u200a2 . 59; 95%CI: 1 . 66\u20134 . 04 , p<0 . 001 ) , exposure to either larval or adult stages of T . solium in Ifakara ( OR\u200a=\u200a15 . 42; 95%CI: 1 . 84\u2013129 . 10 , p\u200a=\u200a0 . 012 ) , exposure to T . canis in all study site ( OR\u200a=\u200a1 . 52; 95%CI: 1 . 23\u20131 . 87 , p<0 . 001 ) , Ifakara ( OR\u200a=\u200a2 . 15; 95%CI: 1 . 46\u20133 . 18 , p<0 . 001 ) and Kilifi ( OR\u200a=\u200a1 . 64; 95%CI: 1 . 11\u20132 . 40 , p\u200a=\u200a0 . 012 ) , T . gondii in all study sites ( OR\u200a=\u200a1 . 28; 95%CI: 1 . 04\u20131 . 56 , p\u200a=\u200a0 . 018 ) and exposure to HIV in Kilifi ( OR\u200a=\u200a3 . 00; 95%CI: 1 . 12\u20138 . 04 , p\u200a=\u200a0 . 028 ) , all of which were associated with increased prevalence of ACE [10] . The association between seropositivity and ACE on analysis of HIV negative individuals ( exclusion of 182 controls and 140 cases who were HIV positive ) had similar results with the exception of T . gondii , in which the positive association was not statistically significant ( Table S6 ) . There was an increase in antibody levels with age in both cases and controls for O . volvulus , T . canis , T . gondii and P . falciparum ( Figure 1 ) with the trend consistent in individual study sites . ACE was associated with high antibody levels ( top tertile ) to O . volvulus , T . canis and T . gondii , although the associations varied in magnitude across the study sites ( Figure 2 and Table 2 , S2\u2013S5 ) . Exposure to P . falciparum alone was not significantly associated with increased risk of ACE in any of the study sites . As shown in Table 2 and Figure 2 using pooled data from all study sites , high antibody levels ( top tertile ) were significantly associated with increased prevalence of ACE for O . volvulus ( OR\u200a=\u200a1 . 66; 95%CI: 1 . 24\u20132 . 21 , p\u200a=\u200a0 . 001 ) , T . canis ( OR\u200a=\u200a1 . 70; 95%CI: 1 . 30\u20132 . 24 , p<0 . 001 ) and T . gondii ( OR\u200a=\u200a1 . 39; 95%CI: 1 . 11\u20131 . 75 , p\u200a=\u200a0 . 004 ) . A dose-response association was observed for Toxocara canis infection both in the pooled analysis ( Table 2 ) and in analysis of individual sites , with the exception of Iganga-Mayuge ( Table S3 ) . The results were similar in an analysis of HIV negative individuals ( Table S7 ) . 73 . 8% of cases and 65 . 5% of controls that were tested for exposure to all six infections had evidence of exposure to two or more infections ( data not shown ) . A high proportion of individuals were exposed to both T . gondii and P . falciparum ( 35% ) , both O . volvulus and P . falciparum ( 28% ) , and T . canis and P . falciparum ( 23% ) . The remaining combinations occurred in less than 15% of individuals . With the exception of exposure to T . solium and HIV ( OR\u200a=\u200a0 . 82; 95%CI: 0 . 15\u20134 . 45 , p\u200a=\u200a0 . 818 ) , exposure to multiple infectious agents was associated with an increased prevalence of ACE after adjusting for age , sex , study site , education ( none , primary , or secondary and above ) , employment , marital status and exposure to other assayed infections with the majority remaining statistically significant ( Table 3 ) . The results were similar in an analysis of HIV negative individuals ( Table S8 ) . There was evidence of interaction on an additive scale in individuals exposed to T . gondii and O . volvulus ( RERI\u200a=\u200a1 . 19; 95%CI: 0 . 27\u20132 . 11 , p\u200a=\u200a0 . 011 ) ( Table 4 ) , which implies that the combined effect of these parasites is greater than the sum of the individual effects . Interaction could not be determined for O . volvulus and P . falciparum co-infection as all cases of ACE with exposure to O . volvulus were also exposed to P . falciparum . The results were similar in an analysis of HIV negative individuals ( Table S9 ) .\nPeople living in SSA are exposed to multiple parasites , some of which are associated with epilepsy[5] , [7] . We have shown that exposure to individual parasites ( O . volvulus , T . canis and T . gondii ) is associated with an increased prevalence of ACE , and for T . canis there is a dose response relationship between antibody level and ACE . For co-infection with T . gondii and O . volvulus , the combined effect was greater than the sum of the individual effects . Exposure to O . volvulus , T . canis and T . gondii was associated with an increased prevalence of epilepsy in other case-control studies [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] , [28] , [29] , [30] . Previous studies reporting the association between parasitic infection and epilepsy have used seropositivity to define exposure[8] , [9] , [14] , [28] , [29] , [31] , [32] , [33] , with none taking into account the degree of exposure as a predictor for risk of ACE . Elevated antibody responses could reflect recent or current infection or could serve as a proxy for estimating the level or degree of exposure as antibody levels would be elevated due to repeated infections . This may explain previously conflicting results , such as the increased prevalence of epilepsy with exposure to T . canis in Burundi[9] and the absence of an association with epilepsy in Tanzania[8] . Furthermore , even within an area , there is heterogeneity in the prevalence of epilepsy[6] , which may be explained by differences in the levels of exposure to certain parasites . With the exception of cysticercosis , the epileptogenesis of parasitic infections is not entirely elucidated[5] . Neurocysticercosis is a well-known risk factor for epilepsy in South America and has also been identified as a risk factor in few studies in Africa [8] , [14] , [34] , [35] , [36] . In this study , the prevalence of antibodies to T . solium was low in all three-study sites . In Ifakara Tanzania , the main agricultural activities include subsistence farming of maize , rice and cassava and fishing is their main source of protein intake and income[37] . The main inhabitants of Ifakara are both Christians and Muslims [37] and it is likely that pork consumption is low among the Muslim inhabitants . Similarly , fishing and farming are the main agricultural activities in Kintampo ( http://www . indepth-network . org ) and the main inhabitants include a large migrant population from the north who are mainly Muslim[38] . The absence of an association in this study is likely to be attributed to cultural practices in which free-range pig rearing and pork consumption is not common [37] , [38] . In addition , the low sensitivity of the detection assay for identifying single viable cysts , calcified cysts or degenerating cysts [20] that could be epileptogenic[39] and possibly the lack of the statistical power to detect an association due to a low prevalence of T . solium antibodies . Other studies have found that a history of admission with cerebral malaria or malaria complicated with seizures have been previously shown to be associated with ACE [10] , [15] . The lack of association between P . falciparum serology and ACE in our study might be because serology cannot currently distinguish between asymptomatic exposure , mild malaria , malaria complicated with seizure or cerebral malaria . We show that exposure to multiple parasitic infections as well as HIV was relatively common and was strongly associated with an increased prevalence of ACE . Although few studies have analysed exposure to two parasites such as cysticercosis and toxocariasis[8] or three parasites , cysticercosis , toxocariasis and paragonimiasis[33] , these studies did not report on the risk of epilepsy associated with exposure to multiple infections . We provide evidence of interaction for an additive model of O . volvulus and T . gondii co-infection . The evidence of interaction in individuals exposed to T . gondii and O . volvulus may be explained by the predominant immune responses induced by the different infections . Interferon gamma ( IFN\u03b3 ) , a Th1 response has been shown to be essential for controlling T . gondii infection[40] . Th2 responses dominate in chronic filarial infections such as Brugia malayi ( in a murine model ) [41] and O . volvulus[42] and this tends to suppress Th1 responses . These observations suggest that individuals with chronic O . volvulus infection who are co-infected with T . gondii may be unable to mount an adequate protective response resulting in increased severity of disease e . g . due to the rupture of cysts containing T . gondii that are then epileptogenic[43] , [44] . There is a need for additional studies in both humans and in animal models to elucidate the mechanisms of pathogenesis with these parasitic infections[5] as well as in models of co-infections in order to gain insight to their role in epilepsy . We measured exposure to infections using well-established and robust techniques . IgG antibodies to Toxocara excretory secretory antigen remain elevated for many years in chronic infections and have been shown to persist for over 4 years after curative treatment[45] . IgG antibodies to T . gondii purified antigens are detectable months after infection[46] . Exposure to P . falciparum determined by detection of IgG antibodies to schizont extract was selected as these antibodies are known to be long-lived and detectable up to 11 years in the absence of antigenic re-stimulation[47] . With the exception of T . solium[20] and O . volvulus whose antibody longevity is unknown , our measurement would detect a current or prior exposure to infection . We used a standardised approach to determine exposure to infections across all study sites , this exposure was determined after the onset of seizures , and as such , it is difficult to confirm a causal link . Despite adjusting for socio-economic status in our statistical analysis , this may not have adequately measured poverty and there might be residual confounding . In addition , the required sample size was not achieved and may explain the differences between the expected and observed associations . The findings from this study should be validated using longitudinal studies that monitor exposure to infections , which may help establish a causal link between parasitic infections and epilepsy . While it is not clear whether it is the presence of the parasite in the CNS or the immunological response to the infection that is epileptogenic , efforts to control these infections are likely to reduce the burden of epilepsy in SSA and should be explored using randomized intervention studies . Control is possible with ivermectin for individual and mass-treatment of onchocerciasis[48] , [49] niclosamide or praziquantel for treatment of taeniasis as well as albendazole or praziquantel for treatment of parasitic cysts such as in T . solium[50] and T . canis infection[51] . In addition , efforts to improve sanitation and personal hygiene practices , including safe food consumption practices , will reduce transmission of T . canis , T . gondii and T . solium infections . Safe pig rearing ( i . e . , separation from human waste contact ) will further impact on T . solium transmission . Vector control measures as well as bed net usage , intermittent preventative treatment and effective chemotherapy are available for control P . falciparum infection[52] . These control measures should be explored and their contribution to the burden of ACE evaluated . While feasible control measures are known , their use depends largely on a wider commitment to improving public health . We have shown that the intensity of exposure to certain infections and multiple parasitic infections is associated with increased prevalence of ACE and may explain conflicting results obtained when only seropositivity is considered . A recent study indicated that approximately 35% of ACE cases in adults in SSA are attributed to parasitic infections[10] . The findings from this study should be further validated using longitudinal studies to confirm a causal link between parasitic infection and epilepsy . Thereafter , randomized intervention studies targeting each parasitic infection should be explored and their contribution to the burden of ACE evaluated .", "output": " In this study, researchers investigated the relationship between exposure to parasitic infections and active convulsive epilepsy (ACE) in five regions across sub-Saharan Africa. They collected blood samples from 986 cases of ACE and 1,313 age-matched community controls and tested for the presence of antibodies to six different parasites: Onchocerca volvulus, Toxocara canis, Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium falciparum, Taenia solium, and HIV.\n\nThe results showed that exposure to Onchocerca volvulus, Toxocara canis, and Toxoplasma gondii was associated with an increased prevalence of ACE. For Toxocara canis, there was a dose-response relationship between antibody level and ACE. Co-infection with Toxoplasma gondii and Onchocerca volvulus had a combined effect that was greater than the sum of the individual effects.\n\nExposure to multiple parasitic infections was relatively common and was strongly associated with an increased prevalence of ACE. The study also found evidence of interaction for an additive model of Onchocerca volvulus and Toxoplasma gondii co-infection.\n\nThe findings suggest that controlling parasitic infections may help reduce the burden of epilepsy in sub-Saharan Africa. However, further research is needed to confirm a causal link between parasitic infections and epilepsy and to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to control these infections.", "topic": "Epilepsy", "cat": []}
{"input": "Perceptual learning has been used to probe the mechanisms of cortical plasticity in the adult brain . Feedback projections are ubiquitous in the cortex , but little is known about their role in cortical plasticity . Here we explore the hypothesis that learning visual orientation discrimination involves learning-dependent plasticity of top-down feedback inputs from higher cortical areas , serving a different function from plasticity due to changes in recurrent connections within a cortical area . In a Hodgkin-Huxley-based spiking neural network model of visual cortex , we show that modulation of feedback inputs to V1 from higher cortical areas results in shunting inhibition in V1 neurons , which changes the response properties of V1 neurons . The orientation selectivity of V1 neurons is enhanced without changing orientation preference , preserving the topographic organizations in V1 . These results provide new insights to the mechanisms of plasticity in the adult brain , reconciling apparently inconsistent experiments and providing a new hypothesis for a functional role of the feedback connections .\nThe adult brain remains plastic long after the developmental period [1] . This ability to remain plastic is fundamental for the adult brain to be able to learn and adapt in the ever-changing sensory environment . However , we do not fully understand the limits and mechanisms of the adult brain plasticity [2] . Perceptual learning \u2013 improvement in perception due to experience with stimuli \u2013 has been used to explore plasticity in sensory cortices [3] . In particular , stimulus specificity of the improvements of orientation discrimination [4]\u2013[6] suggests that the primary visual cortex , area V1 , where neurons have small receptive fields , is the site for cortical changes that underlie the improvement of orientation discrimination . However , it is still unclear what cellular and synaptic changes in V1 are responsible for such perceptual learning . Reports of learning-dependent changes of V1 neurons are inconsistent: Learning to discriminate orientations of visual stimuli in one study resulted in sharpening orientation tuning curves in a subgroup of V1 neurons [7] ( Fig . 1A\u2013D ) ; others found instead that responses to the trained orientation reduced in V1 neurons [8] ( Fig . 1E , F ) . In both studies , V1 neurons responded preferably to the same orientations as they did before learning , thus preserving the topographic organization in V1 . Previous models of visual perceptual learning based on plasticity of the recurrent and feedforward connections [9]\u2013[10] could neither explain the observed stability of orientation preferences of V1 neurons nor reconcile the findings of the aforementioned experiments . Here we suggest that learning-dependent changes in V1 cortex involve top-down projections into V1 from higher cortical areas . In a spiking neural network model of visual cortex ( Fig . 2 ) , we showed that repeated stimulus presentations resulted in strengthening the feedforward connections from V1 neurons to neurons in a higher visual area ( such as area V2 ) . Greater activity in V2 in turn led to strengthening the feedback connections from V2 to V1 neurons , which helped to maintain the stability of the V1\u2013V2 network through shunting inhibition [11]\u2013[12] . As a consequence of the shunting inhibition , V1 neurons had enhanced orientation selectivity and responded to a narrower range of orientations . The diffuse nature of the feedback inputs to V1 neurons allowed improvement of orientation selectivity in V1 neurons without changing their orientation preferences , thus preserving the map of orientation representations in V1 . The feedback model reproduced both the previously observed sharpening and reduction of neural responses , but not in the same V1 neurons . We assume that previous studies might have recorded from different populations of V1 neurons . We suggest that the stability of cortical representations in V1 may be critical for normal visual processing , and learning-dependent plasticity of visual cortex could be based on mechanisms that preserve the topography of cortical maps .\nTo explore mechanisms of learning-induced changes in V1 we designed a simple network model consisting of two cortical areas ( V1 and V2 ) and including plastic feedforward and feedback connections ( Fig . 2; see also Models ) . In the model , a stimulus was presented to V1 neurons on many repetitions , which resulted in strengthening the feedforward connections from V1 to V2 neurons ( Fig . 3A ) . Higher levels of activity in V2 neurons in turn led to strengthening the feedback connections from V2 back to V1 neurons . The excitatory feedbacks targeted both the excitatory and inhibitory neurons in V1 ( Fig . 3B ) and resulted in balanced recurrent excitatory and inhibitory currents in V1 , which canceled each other at the resting potential of V1 neurons leading to shunting inhibition of V1 neurons ( Fig . 3C ) . Strengthening the feedback inputs with learning did not change the balance but increased the amplitudes of both the recurrent excitatory and inhibitory currents ( Fig . 3D ) . Thus , although the feedback inputs were excitatory , they suppressed activity in V1 neurons through shunting inhibition mechanism , thus maintaining stability of the network . Due to the diffuse nature of the feedback inputs in the model , the shunting inhibition affected responses of all V1 neurons . By applying a range of input stimuli , we tested f-I curve in a V1 neuron that did not respond to the trained stimulus but received the modified feedback input . After training , the f-I curve of the V1 neuron shifted to the right , resulting in a subtractive effect on neural responses ( Fig . 3E ) . This was because the strong feedback inputs resulted in stronger recurrent excitatory and inhibitory input currents , which decreased input resistance at the resting potential of the neuron . As we the depolarized membrane potential by applying a direct current to the V1 neuron , the driving force of the inhibitory current increased and the driving force of the excitatory current to the neuron decreased causing shunting inhibition in the neuron . Thus , shunting inhibition can reduce neural responses by counteracting the driving stimulus , as was previously predicted [12] . After training the model with a stimulus , we observed that both amplitude and width of tuning curve of a V1 neuron that preferred the trained orientation reduced due to the shunting inhibition ( Fig . 4A , B ) . However , slope of the neuron's tuning curve did not change significantly ( Fig . 4D ) . We refer to this change in the tuning curve as \u201creduction\u201d of the response . In another V1 neuron , for which the trained orientation was not the preferred one , reduction of the width of the tuning curve was greater than reduction of the response amplitude ( Fig . 4B , C ) , which steepened the slope of the tuning curve ( Fig . 4D ) . We refer to this change as \u201csharpening\u201d the tuning curve . Thus , the reduction of responses was observed in V1 neurons that preferred the trained orientation , and sharpening of tuning curves was observed in V1 neurons that responded to the trained orientation but preferred orientations different from the trained one . To understand causes of different changes of the tuning curves of V1 neurons ( Fig . 4 ) , we explored stimulus dependence of neural changes in V2 . Learning resulted in strengthening connections from excitatory neurons representing the trained stimulus in V1 to excitatory neurons representing the trained stimulus in V2 ( Fig . 5A ) . Higher activity in those V2 neurons resulted in strong feedback inputs to all V1 neurons ( Fig . 5D ) , which led to overall reduction of neural responses in V1 due to shunting inhibition ( Fig . 5E , red lines ) . A novel stimulus activated a population of V2 neurons that included some V2 neurons with previously modified connections and other V2 neurons with unmodified connections ( Fig . 5B ) . Hence , the feedback inputs from the experienced V2 neurons were combined with feedback inputs from na\u00efve V2 neurons , which resulted in a lesser increase of the overall feedback inputs to V1 neurons ( Fig . 5D ) and led to a sharper tuning curve ( Fig . 5E , green lines ) . Finally , a stimulus that activated V2 neurons with unmodified synapses ( Fig . 3C ) did not change the feedback inputs to V1 ( Fig . 5D ) , therefore , no changes of tuning curves were observed in V1 neurons ( Fig . 5E , purple lines ) . Thus , after learning , strength of the feedback input depended on orientation of a stimulus: The feedback inputs were the strongest for the trained orientation and weakened as stimulus orientation moved away from the trained orientation . To understand how varying strength of the feedback inputs led to either firing rate reduction or sharpening of the tuning curves of V1 neurons ( Fig . 4A and 4C ) , we analyzed how recurrent interactions within V1 network change response properties of V1 neurons by comparing the responses of two V1 neurons positioned at different locations with respect to the stimuli . In agreement with experimental data from V1 [13]\u2013[15] , recurrent interactions among V1 neurons increased responses of strongly responding V1 neurons and suppressed responses of weakly responding V1 neurons ( Fig . 6A ) . This occurred because recurrent interactions effectively increased nonlinearity of input-output relations in V1 neurons ( Fig . 6B ) . The new input-output function had an intermediate area where the slope changed most strongly . We refer to this region as an area of strong nonlinearity . The trained stimulus , which was the preferred stimulus for neuron A ( Fig . 6C ) , evoked strong feedback inputs and resulted in proportional reduction of neural responses in both strongly ( e . g . neuron A ) and weakly ( e . g . neuron B ) responding V1 neurons ( Fig . 6C ) . This proportional reduction was because the strong feedback equally affected neurons A and B by shifting responses in both neurons beyond the area of strong nonlinearity ( Fig . 6D ) . A novel stimulus , which was the preferred for neuron B , evoked weaker feedback inputs and led to the sharpening of V1 neural responses ( Fig . 6E ) . This sharpening was because not-so-strong feedback affected neurons A and B differently . The feedback shifted the response of neuron A beyond the area of strong nonlinearity , which led to a strong reduction of its response . In contrast , the response of neuron B remained outside the area of strong nonlinearity and displayed only a minor decrease ( Fig . 6F ) . This difference in the firing rate change of different V1 neurons resulted in sharpening of the population response ( Fig . 6E ) . Thus , the strong nonlinearity of the input-output function of V1 neurons and the varying strength of the feedback inputs produced different changes in the neural population , reducing the responses of some neurons and sharpening the tuning curves of others . These changes of the population responses observed in our model were similar to the reported changes of the tuning curves in V1 neurons following perceptual learning [7]\u2013[8] .\nOur model pertains to experiments that involve learning to discriminate low-level features of visual stimuli presented at a particular location within receptive field of V1 neurons . We explored here if learning-induced changes in V1 were not due to synaptic plasticity of short-range recurrent connections among nearby V1 neurons within a hypercolumn but instead were due to changes in feedback inputs to V1 neurons from neurons in higher visual areas . There may be other types of plasticity in the long-range horizontal connections between distant hypercolumns that can explain other types of learning experiments involving complex tasks and large stimuli [25]\u2013[27] . Reduction of neural responses and sharpening of tuning curves in our model resulted from strong nonlinearity of input-output relations in V1 neurons and varying strengths of stimulus evoked feedback inputs to V1 neurons . The intrinsic nonlinearity of input-output relations in V1 neurons was further amplified by recurrent interactions . The variation of strengths of the feedback inputs resulted from the assumption that a population of V2 neurons representing a stimulus had a finite size . Therefore , the trained and novel stimuli evoked responses in an overlapping but different neuronal populations , which resulted in different feedback inputs to V1 neurons upon presentation of the trained vs . novel stimuli . Thus , both reduction of the neural responses and sharpening were observed in V1 network but in different populations of V1 neurons with respect to the location of stimulation . The learning process in the model was incremental: More training resulted in stronger feedforward and feedback connections , and therefore led to stronger reduction and sharpening . Robustness of the results was tested by varying the synaptic weights in the model , which produced consistent behavior over a range of parameter values . Other aspects of the model were based on neural data and did not affect the conclusions . In a previous study , driving a spiking neuron with balanced excitation and inhibition currents changed the slope of the gain function ( input-output function ) [11] . The changes of the gain functions were caused by shunting inhibition due to balanced excitation and inhibition and noise in the input currents . However , in perceptual learning experiments analysis of noise in V1 neural responses before and after learning did not show any change in the noise level [7] . In the current model , input noise did not change with training because the firing rates in V1 did not increase with learning , and firing rates in V2 were maintained through the feedback mechanism . Thus , in the model , balanced excitatory and inhibitory feedback currents were solely responsible for the subtractive inhibition in V1 neurons , in agreement with the experiments . In our model , the feedback mechanism of learning resulted in symmetric changes of the tuning curves in V1 . However , tuning curves of V1 neurons can in fact adapt and become asymmetric in response to repeated stimulus presentation [28] . This adaptation may be due to short-term synaptic depression and facilitation in the recurrent connections , which can result in asymmetric changes of the tuning curves . In contrast , the changes in V1 discussed in our study are due to long-term changes in the feedforward and feedback connections . Both adaptation and learning could take place during stimulation and two processes could interact with each other [29]\u2013[31] . The critical distinction between adaptation and learning is that learning , unlike adaptation , is task dependent . Both adaptation and learning can take various forms due to diversity of plasticity mechanisms ( Hebbian , homeostatic , reinforcement , etc ) that could be evoked by the stimulus [32] . However , with learning to perform a task , changes that enhance performance are reinforced , and changes that do not improve performance are suppressed , a distinction that may depend on a reinforcement signal . We have not included a reinforcement signal in our model , and instead assumed that plasticity of feedforward and feedback connections somehow depended on the task . Although recurrent connections did not contribute to learning in our model , they could be the basis for adaptation . Thus , both learning and adaptation can occur simultaneously and their relative contribution can be context specific . In many experiments on visual perceptual learning , the improvements of perception were stimulus specific [4]\u2013[6] , suggesting that early visual areas were possible sites for the changes underlying visual perceptual learning . However , under some conditions learning can be generalized to other locations in the visual field [29] , [33] . These observations can be explained by stimulus-invariant changes occurring in higher decision-making cortical areas that augment those in lower visual areas . In our model of learning-induced plasticity of V1 , we did not consider if/how changes in V1 could improve perception . In order to understand how perceptual learning could be generalized to other stimuli and locations , we would need to expand the model to include read-out decision-making circuits . However , modeling plasticity in the higher cortical areas , in addition to the changes in V1 , is beyond the scope of this study , which is focused on changes that have been observed in V1 . Our study suggests that two previously reported inconsistent experimental results [7]\u2013[8] may represent recordings from two different populations of V1 neurons: One population of neurons that prefer the trained stimulus , and another that prefer different stimuli but still respond to the trained stimulus . Our model also predicts that learning results in strengthening feedback inputs into V1 , which cause shunting inhibition in V1 neurons . This novel mechanism of learning can be tested by measuring input resistances in relevant V1 pyramidal cells during in vivo stimulation before and after learning . Despite of limited nature of learning-induced changes in V1 , these changes could contribute to other learning-dependent changes in visual cortex , because of the hierarchical organization of the visual system [34]\u2013[35] . Indeed , a learning-induced sharpening of orientation tuning curves was observed in an extrastriate visual area V4 [36] , which could be at least partially due to more sharply-tuned inputs from V1 . Feedback projections are ubiquitous in cortex [37]\u2013[38] , but despite recent progress [39]\u2013[42] , little is known about functional roles of feedback connections in cortical plasticity . Our work presents a new hypothesis for the role of the feedback connections in cortical plasticity . We propose that top-down inputs are plastic and involved in perceptual learning . This prediction can be tested by blocking synaptic plasticity in extrastriate visual cortical areas and observing whether this would diminish learning-induced improvement of behavior .\nWe explore the feedback hypothesis in a spiking neural network model of the visual cortex ( Fig . 2 ) . The model consisted of two layers . Layer one represented the primary visual cortex V1 and layer two represented a higher cortical area V2 . In the biological visual cortex , feedforward inputs from V1 drive activity in V2 neurons , but feedback inputs from V2 neurons back to V1 do not drive but modulate activity in V1 [43]\u2013[44] , thus avoiding a strong positive feedback loop that could lead to uncontrolled epileptic-like oscillations [45] . In the model , V1 neurons activated V2 neurons through the convergent feedforward connections ( Fig . 2 ) . The diffuse feedback inputs from V2 did not drive V1 neurons , but altered their response functions through shunting inhibition mechanism [11]\u2013[12] . Shunting inhibition in the model was due to the balanced excitatory and inhibitory to the excitatory V1 neurons , which modulated neural responses in V1 neurons by subtracting neural responses to driving stimuli .", "output": " In this study, researchers explore the role of feedback connections in the adult brain's plasticity, specifically in the context of visual orientation discrimination learning.

{"input": "Mosquitoes in the Culex pipiens complex thrive in temperate and tropical regions worldwide , and serve as efficient vectors of Bancroftian lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) caused by Wuchereria bancrofti in Asia , Africa , the West Indies , South America , and Micronesia . However , members of this mosquito complex do not act as natural vectors for Brugian LF caused by Brugia malayi , or for the cat parasite B . pahangi , despite their presence in South Asia where these parasites are endemic . Previous work with the Iowa strain of Culex pipiens pipiens demonstrates that it is equally susceptible to W . bancrofti as is the natural Cx . p . pipiens vector in the Nile Delta , however it is refractory to infection with Brugia spp . Here we report that the infectivity barrier for Brugia spp . in Cx . p . pipiens is the mosquito midgut , which inflicts internal and lethal damage to ingested microfilariae . Following per os Brugia exposures , the prevalence of infection is significantly lower in Cx . p . pipiens compared to susceptible mosquito controls , and differs between parasite species with <50% and <5% of Cx . p . pipiens becoming infected with B . pahangi and B . malayi , respectively . When Brugia spp . mf were inoculated intrathoracically to bypass the midgut , larvae developed equally well as in controls , indicating that , beyond the midgut , Cx . p . pipiens is physiologically compatible with Brugia spp . Mf isolated from Cx . p . pipiens midguts exhibited compromised motility , and unlike mf derived from blood or isolated from the midguts of Ae . aegypti , failed to develop when inoculated intrathoracically into susceptible mosquitoes . Together these data strongly support the role of the midgut as the primary infection barrier for Brugia spp . in Cx . p . pipiens . Examination of parasites recovered from the Cx . p . pipiens midgut by vital staining , and those exsheathed with papain , suggest that the damage inflicted by the midgut is subcuticular and disrupts internal tissues . Microscopic studies of these worms reveal compromised motility and sharp bends in the body; and ultrastructurally the presence of many fluid or carbohydrate-filled vacuoles in the hypodermis , body wall , and nuclear column . Incubation of Brugia mf with Cx . p . pipiens midgut extracts produces similar internal damage phenotypes; indicating that the Cx . p . pipiens midgut factor ( s ) that damage mf in vivo are soluble and stable in physiological buffer , and inflict damage on mf in vitro .\nLymphatic filariasis ( LF ) is caused by any of three mosquito-borne nematodes , W . bancrofti , Brugia malayi , or B . timori . Over 120 million people in 80 countries in the tropics and sub-tropics suffer are infected predominately with W . bancrofti , and another 1 . 2 billion are at risk [1] . Infection with these parasites can result in serious morbidity and can cause disfigurement of the limbs and male genitalia , i . e . elephantiasis and hydrocele [2] , [3]; that leads to adverse economic and psychosexual effects . Disease elimination programs utilizing mass drug administration ( MDA ) in endemic areas have yielded promising results [4] , but concerns exist about implementing drug administration in the absence of vector control [5] , geographic expansion of the disease resulting from mass migrations from rural to urban areas [6] , [7] , the potential of parasite drug resistance [8] , and the utility of MDA for control of zoonotic subperiodic B . malayi , which unlike W . bancrofti infects a range of non-human mammals [9] , [10] . Culex pipiens pipiens and Cx . p . quinquefasciatus are principal vectors of W . bancrofti in urban areas of Asia , Africa , the Western Pacific , and South America [11] . These species oviposit in stagnant polluted water , and populations are increasing and expanding due to creation of favorable habitats caused by urbanization [5] , irrigation [12] , and in the Nile Delta , creation of the Aswan High Dam [12] . Despite their susceptibility for W . bancrofti , neither Cx . p . pipiens nor Cx . p . quinquefasciatus transmits Brugia parasites in South Asia , although natural populations are present in endemic areas [11] . Instead , nocturnally periodic B . malayi is primarily transmitted by Anopheles species , subperiodic B . malayi by Mansonia species [11] , and the closely related B . pahangi , a coendemic filarial parasite of non-human mammals , by Armigeres and Mansonia species [13] . Several extrinsic and intrinsic factors govern the ability of a particular mosquito species to harbor and transmit a particular pathogen . Examination of vector-parasite interactions can identify potential vectors as well as provide understanding of the mechanisms underlying susceptibility and refractoriness . This information is valuable for the determination of transmission dynamics of disease in endemic areas . In this paper we define the selective barrier for Brugia development in Cx . p . pipiens that conversely has no deleterious effect on the development of W . bancrofti [14] . In normal development , W . bancrofti and Brugia microfilariae ( mf ) are ingested in a blood meal , penetrate the mosquito midgut and traverse the hemocoel to invade the thoracic muscle cells , then develop to the infective third larval stage that migrates to the mosquito head . The inability of Cx . p . pipiens to support the development and transmission of Brugia malayi and B . pahangi is apparently biological and occurs at the level of the midgut , based on observations that ingested Brugia microfilariae ( mf ) perish in the midgut soon after feeding [15] , and that they can not be detected histologically or by immunohistology in extraintestinal tissues at any time point post-infection [16] . In the relatively rare case that B . pahangi mf do survive to penetrate the midgut and enter the thoracic musculature , development of the worms to infective third-stage larvae progresses normally; suggesting that this mosquito is otherwise physiologically compatible with Brugia spp . and that the midgut is the barrier to infection [17] . Here we examine the Culex midgut as an infection barrier , and present observations on Brugia mf compromised by the midgut that exhibit abnormal motility and evidence of internal damage . These studies were conducted using a laboratory strain of Cx . p . pipiens that was previously shown to be equally susceptible to W . bancrofti as the natural Cx . p . pipiens vector in the Nile Delta [14] .\nSources of mf for these studies included Brugia-infected dark-clawed Mongolian gerbils ( Meriones unguiculatus ) infected at UW-Madison ( UWM ) , as well as infected gerbils obtained from the NIH Filariasis Research Reagent Resource Center ( FR3 ) at the University of Georgia , Athens; and microfilaremic blood obtained from the FR3 . These Brugia strains , maintained for three decades by FR3 , most probably originate from Koala Lampur ( L . Ash and J . McCall , personal communication ) and are herein referred to collectively as Brugia , or Brugia spp . ) . All animal use protocols were approved by UW-Oshkosh and UW-Madison Institutional Animal Care and Use committees . Per os exposure of Aedes aegypti ( Black eye Liverpool strain , LVP ) and an Iowa strain of Cx . p . pipiens to Brugia mf was accomplished by feeding 3- to 6-day-old mosquitoes directly on anesthetized gerbils using established procedures [18] , [19] . Female mosquitoes were sucrose-starved for 8\u201312 hr prior to blood feeding on microfilaremic gerbils . Third-stage larvae were quantified 9\u201312 days post-exposure by dissecting cold-anesthetized mosquitoes in Hank's balanced salt solution ( HBSS ) ( Fisher Scientific , Piscataway , NJ ) and enumerating emerging larvae using a dissecting microscope . Infection intensity between groups was assessed using the TTEST function in Microsoft Excel ( Microsoft , Redmond , WA ) . Aedes aegypti ( Black eye Liverpool strain , LVP ) and an Iowa strain of Cx . p . pipiens were maintained in a 100 sq ft walk-in environmental chamber at 26 . 5\u00b10 . 5\u00b0C and 80\u00b15% relative humidity . Lighting was maintained on a 16 hr light and 8 hr dark cycle with a 90 min crepuscular period at the beginning and end of each light cycle . Rearing of mosquitoes follows well-established protocols that have been detailed previously , with exposures to natural blood meals on anesthetized rabbits ( LVP ) and chickens ( Cx . p . pipiens ) [20] , [21] . Mosquito larvae were maintained on Tetramin\u00ae fish food , fed as a slurry , and adults provided 0 . 3 M sucrose on cotton pads . For mosquito inoculations , Brugia mf were purified from fresh ( <2 day old ) blood samples by syringe tip filtration through 5 uM membranes ( Millipore Isopore TMTP , Billerica , MA ) as previously described [22] . Intrathoracic inoculation of Brugia mf into Ae . aegypti using Aedes saline , and Cx . p . pipiens using Hank's balanced salt solution ( HBSS; Fisher Scientific , Pittsburgh , PA ) , were performed as previously described [23] . Third-stage larvae were enumerated and intensities statistically compared as described above . Isolation of midgut-derived mf was accomplished by dissecting midguts from bloodfed Ae . aegypti within one hour of feeding because Brugia mf typically penetrate the midgut within 1 . 5 hours in this strain , and from Cx . p . pipiens at 2\u20134 hours after feeding to collect mf that displayed the compromised phenotype and were still alive . The midguts were teased apart in cold HBSS to release mf , and the mf were isolated by filtering the mixture through a syringe tip membrane as described above . Vital staining of midgut-derived mf was performed by adding an equivalent volume of 0 . 4% trypan blue solution ( Sigma Chemical , St . Louis , MO ) incubating at room temperature for 1 hr , then filtering the mf from the stain using a small syringe tip filter with a 20 \u00b5M nylon membrane ( GE , Tevose , PA ) into a small watch glass containing HBSS . Individual mf were transferred to slides for microscopic examination using pulled capillary needles . To enzymatically remove the sheaths from midgut-derived mf , treatment with papain was performed as previously described [24] using purified enzyme ( NeuroPapain , Genlantis , San Diego , CA ) , and mf were recovered by filtration and wet-mounted on to glass slides in HBSS for microscopic evaluation as described above . Midguts free of foregut , hindgut , and Malpighian tubules were isolated from 3- to 6-day-old adult female Ae . aegypti and Cx . p . pipiens mosquitoes by dissection , flash frozen on dry ice , and stored at \u221280\u00b0C in aliquots of 50 midguts per 0 . 6 mL tube . Extracts were made by suspending midguts in chilled HBSS on ice at a ratio of 0 . 5 \u00b5L buffer to 1 midgut , then compressing the midguts with a 0 . 5 mL Kontes pellet pestle ( Fisher Scientific , Pittsburgh , PA ) using \u223c10 gentle presses . The mixture was microcentrifuged at 5 , 000\u00d7 g for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C to pellet the midguts . The supernatant was removed to a new 1 . 5 mL tube and microcentrifuged at 10 , 000\u00d7 g for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C to pellet remaining particulates . The cleared crude extract was aliquotted into sterile 0 . 6 \u00b5L tubes and stored at \u221280\u00b0C . Blood-derived B . malayi mf were filtered and concentrated into a small volume of HBSS as described above , and were added to thawed midgut lysates in a sterie 0 . 6 \u00b5L tube at ratios of \u223c6 mf per midgut . The mf were incubated at 26\u00b0C for 2 hours , then were transferred to glass slides for microscopic examination , or subjected to vital staining or papain treatment . Midgut-derived mf were fixed on 0 . 2 \u00b5m syringe tip silver filters with 2 . 5% glutaraladehyde prepared in 0 . 05 M sodium phosphate buffer ( SPB ) overnight , washed twice with SPB , dehydrated through a graded ethanol series , and then critical point dried ( Tousimis Samdri-780A , Rockville , MD ) . The specimens were Sputter Coated with a \u223c25 nm layer of gold/palladium and imaged with an SEM accelerating voltage at 10 kv ( Hitachi S-570 , Pleasanton , CA ) . Midgut-derived mf were fixed in Karnovsky's fixative ( 2 . 5% glutaraldehyde/2 . 0% formaldehyde in 0 . 1 M NaPO4 buffer ( PB , pH\u200a=\u200a7 . 2 ) at 4\u00b0C . For ease of specimen handling ( and to prepare the samples for flat embedding ) the following steps were followed . Samples were lightly vacuumed onto 0 . 4 \u00b5m filters and enrobed in molten 2% low temperature agarose cooled to \u223c50\u00b0C . The agarose was lightly pressed onto the sample into sheets and immediately cooled on a pre-chilled aluminum block ( \u221220\u00b0C ) . Excess bare agarose was dissected and discarded with all remaining steps performed on the specimens in glass vials on a rotator . The agarose samples were placed into fresh Karnovsky's fixative for 2 hours and post-fixed with 1% OsO4 in PB for 1 hour at RT . The samples were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series and embedded in Spurr's low viscosity resin ( ERL 4221 formulation , Polysciences Inc . Warrington , PA ) . Specimens were sectioned on a Leica UC6 ultra-microtome , stained in uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate and viewed on a Philips CM120 ( FEI Co . Eindhoven , Netherlands ) at 80 kV . Images were collected on an Olympus-SIS MegaView III ( Olympus-SIS Corp . , Lakewood , CO ) digital camera . Mf motility was observed with an Olympus SZH10 zoom stereomicroscope , with maximum magnification of 70\u00d7 . Images were visualized using the attached DC-330 color camera ( Dage-MTI Inc . , Michigan City , IN ) , with signal conversion from S-video to DV by an ADVC-55 digital video converter ( Green Valley/Canopus ) , and MPEG4 videos were captured using MPEGCraft 3 DVD version 3 . 03 ( Canopus ) . Original video clips were imported into iMovie '09 version 8 . 0 . 6 ( Apple Inc . ) to edit for run time and to highlight movements of particular worms by cropping them out of specified fields . Final videos were converted to ACC files . See Video S1 and S2 . Digital micrographs were labeled using Adobe Photoshop CS5 ( Adobe Systems Incorporated , San Jose , CA ) .\nLess than half ( 43\u201346% ) of the Cx . p . pipiens exposed to B . pahangi-infected gerbils became infected , compared to 95% in Ae . aegypti . For sake of comparison , when this Culex strain was exposed to W . bancrofti collected from human volunteers in the Nile Delta , infection prevalence ranged from 59 . 2% and 61 . 2% prevalence [14] . Infection intensities in Cx . p . pipiens also were statistically lower than for Ae . aegypti as determined by testing of the null hypothesis by two-tailed Student's T-test ( p<0 . 001 ) ( Table 1 ) . Cx . p . pipiens was , however , almost completely refractory to B . malayi , with a single third-stage larva found in a mosquito exposed to a very high microfilaremia . Because B . pahangi is more easily propagated in the laboratory , and it is easier to collect sufficient numbers of B . pahangi mf; we chiefly used B . pahangi for downstream experiments . To determine if Cx . p . pipiens is physiologically compatible for Brugia infection , we bypassed the midgut by inoculating blood-derived mf directly into the hemocoel of adult female mosquitoes . Introducing blood-derived B . pahangi mf directly into the Cx . p . pipiens hemocoel resulted in thoracic muscle invasion and normal larval development to intensities comparable to control mosquitoes ( p>0 . 1 with Student's T-test for unpaired samples ) ( Table 2 ) . We observed similar results in an unreplicated inoculation experiment with B . malayi ( prevalence in Cx . p . pipiens 76% with intensity of 2 . 1 L3/mosquito , n\u200a=\u200a21; Ae . aegypti prevalence 100% , intensity 6 L3/mosquito , n\u200a=\u200a20 ) . Midgut-derived B . pahangi mf from Cx . p . pipiens , however , failed to develop when inoculated into the susceptible Ae . aegypti strain ( Table 2 ) , indicating that damage incurred within the midgut is lethal . In all inoculation experiments , a subset of mosquitoes in each group was dissected within 3 hours of inoculation to verify that mf were successfully introduced ( data not shown ) . B . pahangi mf recovered from Cx . p . pipiens midguts displayed compromised motility and in some cases kinked posture , characterized by stiffening of worms that bent at angles instead of displaying the sigmoidal thrashing movement characteristic of viable , Ae . aegypti ( LVP ) -derived mf ( Supplements S-1and S-2 ) . This effect also was observed in mf that were incubated in soluble Cx . p . pipiens midgut extracts in vitro ( data not shown ) , and presumably arose from deleterious effects of the midgut environment on mf tissues . Internal damage was visible in midgut-derived mf observed by light microscopy in the form of visible internal vacuolization , which was further investigated by vital staining in 0 . 4% trypan blue . Healthy Ae . aegypti midgut-derived mf did not internally absorb stain , but in some cases stain was observed in the space between the sheath and the cuticle at the head or tail ( data not shown ) . The vital stain , however , freely crossed the cuticle of Cx . p . pipiens midgut-derived Brugia mf and stained internal body cells , often within the central third of the worm length , providing evidence of internal cell death . Brugia mf are covered with a vestige of the eggshell membrane that forms a membranous chitinous sheath . A standard procedure to enzymatically remove the sheath is to treat mf with 10 mg/mL papain , which successfully removes the sheaths from blood-derived mf with no harm to the worms [24] . In an effort to visualize the underlying cuticle of midgut-derived B . pahangi mf , we subjected them to papain treatment to remove the sheaths , and found that treatment efficiently removed the sheaths of blood and Ae . aegypti-derived mf with no harm to the worms , but completely dissolved Cx . p . pipiens-derived mf . At 1/10 the recommended papain concentration , most control mf were exsheathed and all were motile , but many Cx . p . pipiens-derived mf were fatally damaged with bulges in the body wall , and spilling of body contents from multiple regions across the body wall ( Figure 1A and B ) ; indicating that damage inflicted by the toxic midgut environment weakened the body wall of Cx . p . pipiens-derived mf to enzymatic attack . Scanning electron microscopy of seven intact midgut-derived B . pahangi mf from each vector species further underscored the kinked phenotype in Cx . p . pipiens-derived worms ( 6 from Cx . p . pipiens versus 2 from Ae . aegypti ) and bagginess of the sheath around Cx . p . pipiens-derived worms ( 5 Cx . p . pipiens-derived mf , 1 Ae . aegypti-derived ) ( Figs . 1C and D ) , and apparent cuticular constrictions in bent regions of Cx . p . pipiens-derived worms ( 4 Cx . p . pipiens-derived , 0 Ae . aegypti-derived ) ( data not shown ) , however direct visualization of the worm surfaces was not possible because of the presence of the overlying microfilarial sheath . Bagginess of the sheath was also observed in longitudinal TEM sections of Cx . p . pipiens-derived worms , however at this level we observed no evidence for cuticular damage or constriction . The most notable ultrastructural observations of sectioned worms was the marked accumulation of vacuoles disrupting the nuclear column and body wall of Cx . p . pipiens-damaged B . pahangi mf ( Figs . 2 and 3A , B ) , disruption of the hypodermis underlying the cuticle ( data not shown ) , and in one case release of visible contents from the excretory vesicle ( Fig . 3C ) .\nPrevious work has demonstrated that Brugia mf fail to penetrate the midgut of Cx . p . pipiens complex mosquitoes and die in the midgut lumen [15] , [25]; that W . bancrofti mf ingested by Cx . p . pipiens are not damaged by the cibarial armature or inhibited from midgut penetration by peritrophic membrane formation [26]; and that different mosquito species and/or strains within this mosquito complex are either completely or partially refractory to B . pahangi [17] , [27] , [28] . Here we present experimental support for these observations and for our hypothesis that the Cx . p . pipiens midgut acts as an innate and selective barrier to infection with B . malayi and B . pahangi . In our studies , the damage inflicted on Brugia mf within the Cx . p . pipiens midgut was largely lethal in nature and precluded further development in extra-intestinal tissues ( i . e . thoracic muscles ) . Our experimental infection data clearly demonstrate that Cx . p . pipiens is otherwise physiologically compatible for Brugia mf , and that the midgut barrier is comparatively more restrictive for B . malayi than for B . pahangi . The mechanism of Cx . p . pipiens-induced midgut damage to Brugia mf is not yet clear but the differential vital staining and protease sensitivity of intact ( Ae . aegypti-derived ) and damaged ( Cx . p . pipiens-derived ) worms indicate that the Cx . p . pipiens midgut environment apparently breaches the mf cuticle , leading to death of cells inside the worms . The subcuticular damage evident in our ultrastructural studies provide insight regarding the compromised \u2018kinked\u2019 movements that are observed in Brugia mf exposed to the Cx . p . pipiens midgut . The mosquito midgut epithelium is one of the first physical barriers encountered by ingested pathogens; it is composed of a single layer of polarized epithelial cells supported by an underlying basal lamina [29] , [30] . The midgut epithelial cells form a microvillar surface on the lumenal side and secrete digestive enzymes into the lumen upon ingestion of a bloodmeal . In mosquito-arboviral systems , midgut infection and escape barriers that have been described include: inhospitable chemical environment of midgut lumen that destroys incoming virions ( e . g . , proteolytic enzymes , pH ) , lack of epithelial receptors for viral attachment and/or entry , dose dependence of epithelial cell infection , and relative abundance of organelles necessary for virion assembly [31] . These intrinsic barrier systems are geneticially controlled , and can be expressed in variable proportions wthin a mosquito population , thereby affecting epidemiology of disease . Mesenteric ( midgut level ) barriers also exist in mosquito species exposed to eukaryotic pathogens . For example , in the case of Plasmodium parasites that cause human and avian malaria , destruction of ookinetes by digestive enzymes can occur in the midgut lumen , increased nitric oxide production and superoxide anion production can kill ookinetes , ookinetes can be killed by pattern-recognition receptor mediated phagocytosis [32] , the absence of molecular recognition sites on midgut cells can prevent ookinete invasion [33] , intracellular Plasmodium ookinetes can be lysed [34] , oocysts can be targeted by phagocyte attack , and oocysts can be encapsulated and melanized [32] . Successful pathogen development is clearly dependent on vector cells and molecules , and on the genetic makeup of the pathogen itself , as evidenced by the selection of arboviruses for attenuation in mosquito vectors and vertebrate hosts [31] , differential susceptibility of culicine and anopheline mosquitoes to avian and human malaria parasites [34]; and the selection of filarial worms for increased infectivity in a permissive vector [35] . The Cx . p . pipiens-Brugia barrier described here is the second filarial midgut barrier reported from mosquitoes that naturally transmit filarial worms ( the first demonstrated that substantial numbers of Dirofilaria immitis mf are retained in the midgut of Aedes trivitattus [36]; and like other described mosquito midgut barriers to viral and eukaryotic pathogen infection , it is expressed at the intra- and interspecific levels [17] , [27] , [37] , and is undoubtedly under complex genetic control . One of the most highly characterized filarial infection barriers is the physiological incompatibility observed in the yellow fever mosquito Ae . aegypti , which is controlled by at least two loci [38]; the major being a sex-linked recessive gene designated fm [39] . The LVP strain of Ae . aegypti that is routinely used to maintain laboratory Brugia strains was selected for susceptibility to subperiodic B . malayi , and is also susceptible to B . pahangi and W . bancrofti , but not to Dirofilaria immitis or D . repens [40] . Filarial worm susceptibility in Cx . pipiens complex mosquitoes is also controlled genetically , but is different than that reported for Ae . aegypti . In direct contrast to the fm gene of Ae . aegypti , the sb gene of Cx . p . pipiens influences the susceptibility of Cx . p . pipiens for Brugia but not W . bancrofti [41] . The genetics of filarial susceptibility are likely more complex for Culex pipiens complex mosquitoes than for Ae . aegypti because Egyptian Cx . p . pipiens populations can be selected for higher susceptibility but not refractoriness for W . bancrofti [42] , and similarly for Cx . p . quinquefasciatus [43]; therefore , it is not surprising to find that the mechanisms of refractoriness could significantly differ between Aedes and Culex vectors . Extensive studies on susceptibility of Cx . tarsalis ( Cx . sitiens complex ) for Western equine encephalitis virus also indicate complex genetics underlying vector competence of a congeneric organism with a midgut infection barrier for a viral pathogen [44] . Most LF elimination efforts follow the WHO-recommended mass administration regimen of treating individuals in endemic areas with anti-filarial drugs annually , to eliminate microfilaria production and prevent transmission to mosquito vectors [45] . In many cases these programs have drastically dropped microfilaremias , providing a cost-effective strategy to improve health on a broad scale and targeting multiple parasitic infections simultaneously [4] . In very few of these localities , however , are vector control efforts being integrated with chemotherapeutic control [5] , despite the observations that implementing vector control practices with MDA can influence key ecological parameters that further sustain LF elimination [5] , [46]; and that in some regions LF transmission has returned after cessation of MDA [47] , [48] . Because ecological and geographical conditions vary greatly between endemic areas , the length of time that the MDA strategy must be continued to eliminate LF transmission is difficult to calculate , is likely region-specific , and depends on many factors including biology of the vector ( s ) involved [45] , [46] , particularly if xenomonitoring is being considered as a tool for program assessment . It is clear that the complex dynamics that govern parasite transmission vary significantly between endemic regions , and that efforts to achieve elimination of LF must be based on local transmission thresholds - to do this , local transmission dynamics must be understood , and this demands understanding of the biology of vector and nonvector mosquito species in these areas , and the competence of local mosquito strains to successfully transmit the parasites .", "output": " In this study, researchers investigated why mosquitoes in the Culex pipiens complex, which are efficient vectors for Bancroftian lymphatic filariasis (LF) caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, do not transmit Brugian LF caused by Brugia malayi or Brugia pahangi. They found that the midgut of Culex pipiens acts as a barrier to infection for Brugia parasites, causing internal and lethal damage to ingested microfilariae.\n\nWhen exposed to Brugia parasites, the prevalence of infection was significantly lower in Culex pipiens compared to susceptible mosquito controls, and differed between parasite species. When Brugia microfilariae were inoculated intrathoracically to bypass the midgut, larvae developed equally well as in controls, indicating that Culex pipiens is physiologically compatible with Brugia parasites beyond the midgut.\n\nMicroscopic studies revealed that Brugia microfilariae isolated from Culex pipiens midguts exhibited compromised motility and sharp bends in the body, with ultrastructural evidence of many fluid or carbohydrate-filled vacuoles in the hypodermis, body wall, and nuclear column. Incubation of Brugia microfilariae with Culex pipiens midgut extracts produced similar internal damage phenotypes, suggesting that the Culex pipiens midgut factor(s) that damage microfilariae in vivo are soluble and stable in physiological buffer, and inflict damage on microfilariae in vitro.\n\nThese findings highlight the importance of understanding vector-parasite interactions and the mechanisms underlying susceptibility and refractoriness in order to determine transmission dynamics of disease in endemic areas. The study also underscores the need for integrated vector control practices with mass drug administration to achieve elimination of lymphatic filariasis.", "topic": "Culex pipiens", "cat": []}
{"input": "Due to the recent increased use of the McMaster ( MM ) fecal egg counting method for assessing benzimidazole drug efficacy for treating soil-transmitted helminth ( STH ) infections , the aim of the current study was to determine the operational value of including the MM method alongside the Kato-Katz ( KK ) fecal thick smear to increase the diagnostic sensitivity when STHs are co-endemic with trematode helminths ( e . g . , Schistosoma mansoni ) . A cross-sectional study was conducted in school-aged children aged 4-18 years in the northeastern region of the State of Minas Gerais ( Brazil ) , where Necator americanus , Ascaris lumbricoides , Trichuris trichiura , and S . mansoni are co-endemic . One fecal sample from each participant was collected and transported to the field laboratory for analysis . Coprological diagnosis was performed on each fecal sample by three different methods: Formalin-Ether Sedimentation ( FES ) , KK and the MM technique . The diagnostic sensitivity and negative predictive value ( NPV ) of each technique was calculated using the combination of all three techniques as the composite standard . In order to determine the agreement between the three techniques Fleiss\u00b4 kappa was used . Both the Cure Rate ( CR ) and the Fecal Egg Count Reduction ( FECR ) were calculated using the two quantification techniques ( i . e . , the MM and KK ) . Fecal samples from 1260 children were analyzed . The KK had higher diagnostic sensitivity than the MM for the detection of both A . lumbricoides ( KK 97 . 3% , MM 69 . 5% ) and hookworm ( KK 95 . 1% , MM 80 . 8% ) . The CR of a single dose of mebendazole varied significantly between the KK and MM for both A . lumbricoides ( p = 0 . 016 ) and hookworm ( p = 0 . 000 ) , with lower rates obtained with the KK . On the other hand , the FECR was very similar between both techniques for both A . lumbricoides and hookworm . The MM did not add any diagnostic value over the KK in areas where both STHs and trematodes were co-endemic . The lower sensitivity of the MM would have an important impact on the administration of selective school-based treatment in this area since if only the MM were used , 36 ( 13 . 9% ) children diagnosed with A . lumbricoides would have gone untreated .\nDespite numerous technological advances in the diagnosis of soil-transmitted helminth ( STH ) infections , such as the development of multiplex and multi-parallel fecal DNA assays [1 , 2] , coprological microscopy techniques remain the standard for diagnosing these infections in humans [3] , including the McMaster ( MM ) counting method [4] and the Kato-Katz ( KK ) fecal thick smear [5] . This is due to their simplicity , ease-of-use in the field , and low cost . Moreover , neither method requires expensive or highly calibrated instrumentation such as a real-time PCR instrument ( multiplex and multi-parallel fecal DNA assay ) , so both can be performed on site in resource-limited endemic areas . The KK method has been the standard technique for the detection and quantification of STH and intestinal trematode infections globally for nearly forty years as reviewed in [6\u201312] and is recommended by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) for the detection of these infections [13] . However , as pointed out by Levecke et al . ( 2011 ) [14] , the KK method has limitations with respect to its qualitative and quantitative diagnostic performance when used to assess STHs in areas endemic for multiple helminth species . These limitations are most apparent when hookworm ( e . g . , Necator americanus ) is one of the co-endemic STHs . With the use of the malachite green-glycerol solution in the KK method , helminth eggs are visualized at different time intervals or \u201cclearing times\u201d after the preparation of a slide . The clearing time for hookworm on a KK slide is limited to 30 minutes after preparation , whereas it is one hour for A . lumbricoides or S . mansoni . However , after 60 minutes , the glycerol solution begins to desiccates the hyaline shell of the hookworm eggs , distorting and eventually collapsing the eggs , so that they are mistaken as something else ( e . g . , a vegetable spore ) or are reported as entirely absent , hence affecting the specificity and sensitivity of the KK for the detection hookworm infection . In contrast , the eggs from A . lumbricoides or S . mansoni can be visualized after hours or even days after the KK slide has been prepared [15] . Moreover , the quantification of egg excretion ( or the intensity of infection ) by the KK method as determined by fecal egg counts ( FEC ) is based on a small fixed volume of feces ( 41 . 7 mg ) and not on the mass of the feces submitted [5] . Hence , the quantitative performance of the KK method is controversial as the density of the feces can vary while the intensity of the eggs excreted is expressed the same , as the number of eggs per gram ( EPG ) of stool [16] . This potential error in FECs obtained by the KK is considered critical in programs monitoring drug efficacy , where it is thought to \u201cintroduce variation in the results and broaden the confidence levels of the resulting statistical parameters\u201d [14] . These properties have also impeded standardization of the KK method in large-scale studies conducted at different study sites . For these reasons , the MM was used as the diagnostic method in several recent large-scale multi-site trials [17 , 18] of efficacy of the anthelminthics albendazole and mebendazole in treating humans for STH infections . While the MM is the standard coprological method to assess STHs in veterinary parasitology , its estimates of FEC , ease of use , and suitability for poorly equipped laboratories , also make it a good choice for public health monitoring of human STHs . The aim of the current study was to determine the operational value of including the MM method in addition to the KK for routine diagnosis in areas co-endemic for several species of helminths ( Fig 1 ) . To this end , the MM and the KK methods were performed on the same fecal sample in a cross-sectional study of over 1 , 200 children aged 4\u201318 years of age in the northeastern region of the state of Minas Gerais , Brazil , where N . americanus , A . lumbricoides , T . trichiura , and S . mansoni are co-endemic , as shown in our previous studies [19 , 20] . More specifically , our objectives were to assess: ( i ) the qualitative diagnostic performance of the KK and MM ( e . g . , diagnostic sensitivity and negative predictive value ) ; ( ii ) the quantitative diagnostic performance of the KK and MM ( fecal egg counts ) ; and ( iii ) the accuracy of both methods for estimating drug efficacy . While recent multinational studies have focused on the relative performances of the MM and KK for monitoring drug efficacy for treatment of STH infections [17 , 18] , to our knowledge , this is the first study to describe the operational value of combining these two techniques for routine public health monitoring of helminth endemicity .\nThe study was approved by the National Ethics Committee of Brazil ( Protocol 454/2009 ) and the Institutional Review Board of the Centro de Pesquisas Ren\u00e9 Rachou ( Belo Horizonte , Brazil ) . Written informed consent was obtained from a parent or guardian of every child . This study was conducted in northeastern , Minas Gerais state , Brazil . Details of the study region have been extensively detailed elsewhere [21 , 22] . Prior studies have confirmed that N . americanus is the sole hookworm species endemic in this region [23 , 24] . The study was conducted as a school-based survey including children between the ages of 4 and 18 years old , inclusive . First , meetings were held with community members to explain the purpose of the study . For the parasitological survey , school personnel and students were informed 24 hours in advance of sample collection and labeled plastic containers were provided . Students were instructed to deposit one fecal sample of each child into the container and return it to school on the following day . Fresh fecal samples were transported at 4\u00b0C and those returned later than 48h after date of distribution were not accepted and new containers were issued . Refrigerated samples were transported to the nearby field laboratory located in Americaninhas , Minas Gerais state , Brazil were they were processed within 24 hours of receipt . Children positive for a STH by any of the three detection techniques described below were treated with a single oral dose of 500 mg mebendazole . Children were asked to provide a second fecal sample 7 to 14 days after treatment to monitor treatment efficacy; these samples were also analyzed by all three coprological techniques . The presence of A . lumbricoides , T . trichiura , hookworm and S . mansoni eggs in feces was determined by trained lab personnel in compliance with standard operating procedures for the 3 different techniques routinely used in the field laboratories of the Centro de Pesquisas Ren\u00e9 Rachou: a ) formalin-ether sedimentation ( FES ) [25]; b ) KK fecal thick smear [5]; and MM counting technique [4] . All data were double-entered in Microsoft Excel ( 2010 Microsoft Corporation ) . Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows , Version 19 . 0 ( Copyright IBM Corporation 1994 , 2013 ) and GraphPad Prism , Version 6 . 0 ( 2015 GraphPad Software , Inc . )\nA total of 1 , 260 children from 23 schools were included in the study , of which 635 ( 50 . 4% ) were female and 625 ( 49 . 6% ) were male . The ages ranged from 4 to 18 years of age , with a mean age of 10 . 1 years . All the children included in the study provided a sufficient volume of feces to perform all 3 diagnostic procedures . A total of 311 children were found to be positive for at least 1 of the 3 STHs and were therefore treated with a single dose of 500 mg mebendazole . Of these , 302 provided fecal samples at follow-up 7\u201314 days following treatment . A total of 312 children were infected with S . mansoni . Since the MM is a flotation technique and therefore does not detect eggs of S . mansoni , the overall prevalence for this helminth ( 24 . 8% ) was calculated using only the FES and KK techniques . Moreover , 46 . 2% of the children diagnosed with S . mansoni were co-infected with at least 1 STH . By combining the results from the 3 different techniques into a composite standard outcome measure , the prevalence for each STH was: 22 . 8% for hookworm , 20 . 6% for A . lumbricoides and 1 . 2% for T . trichiura . The overall prevalence and the individual prevalence obtained using each technique is detailed in Table 1 . Table 1 summarizes the relative performance characteristics of the 3 different fecal techniques used for the diagnosis of STH infections . Although the technique with the best performance for the diagnosis of hookworm proved to be FES , the kappa statistic ( Table 2 ) showed an almost perfect agreement between all 3 techniques , with a Fleiss\u2019 \u03ba of 0 . 887 . On the other hand , for A . lumbricoides , the technique with the best performance was the KK . Again , Fleiss\u2019 kappa statistics comparing the techniques showed almost perfect agreement between them with a \u03ba of 0 . 843 , although Cohen\u2019s kappa statistics showed only substantial agreement between the KK and MM ( \u03ba = 0 . 794 ) and between the FES and MM ( \u03ba = 0 . 791 ) . Regarding the diagnosis of T . trichiura , both FES and KK were equally useful , with almost perfect agreement between them ( Cohen\u2019s kappa of 0 . 845 ) . On the other hand , the agreement between the KK and MM techniques and between the MM and FES was only substantial ( \u03ba = 0 . 629 and 0 . 698 , respectively ) . The overall agreement between all 3 techniques for T . trichiura as measured by Fleiss\u2019 kappa was of substantial agreement ( \u03ba = 0 . 694 ) . The comparison of the 2 techniques used for the diagnosis of S . mansoni demonstrated that the KK performed better than the FES , although Cohen\u2019s kappa statistic showed almost perfect agreement between them with a \u03ba of 0 . 841 ( Table 2 ) . The maximum EPG count , geometric and arithmetic mean of the EPG counts , standard deviation from the mean , and lower and upper 95% confidence intervals for STHs and S . mansoni obtained with the KK and MM counting techniques are summarized in Table 3 . This table also summarizes the infection intensities of the positive samples , stratified into light , moderate or heavy infections . The mean EPG was significantly higher with the KK than the MM , as evaluated using the related-samples Wilcoxon Ranked Signed Test ( p<0 . 001 ) , for hookworm ( 207 . 39 vs . 86 . 53 EPG ) and A . lumbricoides ( 3940 . 01 vs . 1329 . 33 EPG ) but not for T . trichiura ( p = 0 . 396 ) . The maximum EPG value was lower with the KK for T . trichiura ( 252 vs . 400 EPG ) , although it was higher for both A . lumbricoides ( 129 , 120 vs . 51 , 250 EPG ) and for hookworm ( 20 , 616 vs . 3850 EPG ) . The relationship between the EPG values obtained for each sample by each technique followed a linear trend as shown by scatter plots presented in Fig 2 . The correlation between the KK and MM based on Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient was significant for all three STHs ( 0 . 86 for A . lumbricoides , 0 . 88 for hookworm and 0 . 63 for T . trichiura ) . Moreover , when the sensitivity of the KK and MM was calculated according to the classification by infection intensity , the KK proved to be more sensitive than the MM for light , medium and heavy infections . This was true for all three STHs detected in the study ( Table 4 ) . In general , the KK technique detected more cases of moderate and heavy intensity infections when compared to the MM counting technique ( Table 5 ) . Using Cohen\u2019s kappa statistics ( \u03ba ) , the agreement in the classification between the MM and KK for the STHs showed differences depending on the species being studied ( Table 5 ) . For hookworm , the agreement was substantial ( \u03ba = 0 . 70 ) for light-intensity infections , slight ( \u03ba = 0 . 11 ) for moderate-intensity infections and poor ( \u03ba = 0 . 00 ) for heavy-intensity infections . For Ascaris , the agreement for both light- and heavy-intensity infections was slight ( \u03ba = 0 . 20 and 0 . 02 , respectively ) while for moderate-intensity infections it was fair ( \u03ba = 0 . 33 ) . The difference observed in A . lumbricoides infection intensities is probably due to the presence of infertile A . lumbricoides eggs since the MM does not detect them because they are too heavy to float . During this study , the presence of infertile A . lumbricoides eggs was annotated and it was observed that the MM does not detect them . In 41 of the 259 cases of A . lumbricoides that were detected ( 15 . 8% of all cases detected ) ; the presence of infertile eggs was observed , but only by the KK method . In 5 of these samples , the MM detected only fertile eggs while the KK detected both fertile and unfertile eggs; the remaining 36 cases that contained only infertile eggs were missed by the MM . For Trichuris , only light-intensity infections were diagnosed by both methods and the agreement between them was slight ( \u03ba = 0 . 19 ) . As shown in Table 6 , the CR was significantly lower when assessed by the KK technique in comparison to the MM for both hookworm ( p < 0 . 001 ) and A . lumbricoides ( p = 0 . 016 ) . Therefore , 22 of the 189 children ( 11 . 6% ) who were treated were determined to be cured from A . lumbricoides by the MM technique but were in fact still infected as determined by the KK . Also , after treatment , the MM failed to detect 38 light hookworm infections out of the 212 children treated ( 17 . 9% ) that were diagnosed using the KK . On the other hand , 4 children ( 1 . 9% ) with light hookworm infections after treatment went undetected by the KK method but were detected by the MM . Nonetheless , this difference in egg detection did not have an impact on the FECR since it was very similar between both techniques . The CR and FECR for T . trichiura were not calculated due to the small number of positive samples found .\nBased on the diagnostic sensitivities of the MM and the KK as reported herein , we do not see the value of the extra time , materials , and labor required by the addition of the MM into a diagnostic strategy for STHs in areas where S . mansoni infection is also present , especially resource limited areas such as our study site in Brazil . Initially , we hypothesized that the MM method would improve the sensitivity for the detection of STHs over the use of the KK alone , especially for the diagnosis of hookworm infections . However , as shown here , the inclusion of the MM in our diagnostic workflow did not improve overall sensitivity . Similarly , the MM could not replace the KK in the study area given its lower sensitivity for diagnosing A . lumbricoides and its inability to detect S . mansoni eggs . Nonetheless , when conducting coprological studies in humans , determining which technique to use will depend on the research question , the expected species of interest , the expected prevalence and intensity of each species and finally , the field conditions for implementation\u2014in other words , \u201cfinding the right tool for the job\u201d .", "output": " In this study, researchers aimed to determine the usefulness of adding the McMaster (MM) method to the Kato-Katz (KK) method for diagnosing soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections in areas where both STHs and trematode helminths are common. They conducted a cross-sectional study in school-aged children in the northeastern region of the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, where Necator americanus, Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and Schistosoma mansoni are co-endemic.\n\nThe researchers collected and analyzed fecal samples from 1260 children using three different methods: Formalin-Ether Sedimentation (FES), KK, and MM. They found that the KK method had higher diagnostic sensitivity than the MM for detecting both A. lumbricoides and hookworm. The cure rate of a single dose of mebendazole varied significantly between the KK and MM for both A. lumbricoides and hookworm, with lower rates obtained with the KK. However, the Fecal Egg Count Reduction (FECR) was very similar between both techniques for both A. lumbricoides and hookworm.\n\nThe study concluded that the MM did not add any diagnostic value over the KK in areas where both STHs and trematodes were co-endemic. The lower sensitivity of the MM would have an important impact on the administration of selective school-based treatment in this area since if only the MM were used, 36 (13.9%) children diagnosed with A. lumbricoides would have gone untreated.\n\nIn summary, this study highlights the importance of using the Kato-Katz method for diagnosing STH infections in areas where both STHs and trematode helminths are common, as it has higher diagnostic sensitivity than the McMaster method. The use of the Kato-Katz method can help ensure that all children infected with STHs receive appropriate treatment.", "topic": "Soil transmitted helminthiasis", "cat": []}
{"input": "Chagas disease , caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi ( T . cruzi ) , is the leading etiology of non-ischemic heart disease worldwide , with Latin America bearing the majority of the burden . This substantial burden and the limitations of current interventions have motivated efforts to develop a vaccine against T . cruzi . We constructed a decision analytic Markov computer simulation model to assess the potential economic value of a T . cruzi vaccine in Latin America from the societal perspective . Each simulation run calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) , or the cost per disability-adjusted life year ( DALY ) avoided , of vaccination . Sensitivity analyses evaluated the impact of varying key model parameters such as vaccine cost ( range: $0 . 50\u2013$200 ) , vaccine efficacy ( range: 25%\u201375% ) , the cost of acute-phase drug treatment ( range: $10\u2013$150 to account for variations in acute-phase treatment regimens ) , and risk of infection ( range: 1%\u201320% ) . Additional analyses determined the incremental cost of vaccinating an individual and the cost per averted congestive heart failure case . Vaccination was considered highly cost-effective when the ICER was \u22641 times the GDP/capita , still cost-effective when the ICER was between 1 and 3 times the GDP/capita , and not cost-effective when the ICER was >3 times the GDP/capita . Our results showed vaccination to be very cost-effective and often economically dominant ( i . e . , saving costs as well providing health benefits ) for a wide range of scenarios , e . g . , even when risk of infection was as low as 1% and vaccine efficacy was as low as 25% . Vaccinating an individual could likely provide net cost savings that rise substantially as risk of infection or vaccine efficacy increase . Results indicate that a T . cruzi vaccine could provide substantial economic benefit , depending on the cost of the vaccine , and support continued efforts to develop a human vaccine .\nChagas disease ( American trypanosomiasis ) , caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi ( T . cruzi ) , is a leading etiology of non-ischemic heart disease worldwide [1] and has a substantial impact on Latin America , resulting in an estimated 750 , 000 productive life years lost and 1 . 2 billion dollars lost annually [2] , [3] , [4] . Chagas disease has three established phases: acute , indeterminate , and chronic . While acute disease is primarily asymptomatic , cases often transition to the chronic phase and clinically manifest as cardiomyopathy and subsequent congestive heart failure ( CHF ) decades after infection [1] , [5] , [6] . Furthermore , those who develop Chagas-related CHF have poorer prognoses and higher mortality rates than those with other CHF etiologies [2] . The substantial burden of Chagas disease and the limitations of current interventions have motivated efforts to develop a vaccine against T . cruzi . Although currently available drugs ( benznidazole and nifurtimox ) are moderately efficacious when administered during the acute phase , they have been minimally successful in treating chronic infection [7] , [8] , [9] . Low rates of symptomatic acute illness limit the utilization ( and thus , the benefit ) of these drugs [5] , [8] . The lack of an available vaccine has left insecticide spraying for T . cruzi vectors ( reduvidae insects ) as the primary control strategy . However , implementing successful mass spraying can be challenging [10] , [11] . Mass spraying requires both repeated and consistent reapplication , which in turn necessitates funding , personnel , and equipment . Due to a lack of national-level funding , local communities may not have the resources to maintain spraying . Furthermore , increased use of insecticides has elicited resistance among vectors in Argentina and Bolivia and may lead to untoward health effects for humans [11] . Several T . cruzi vaccine candidates have demonstrated protective effects against challenge in mouse models and offer promise for the future development of a human vaccine [12] , . Much attention has focused on DNA vaccines , consisting of one or more antigen-coding plasmids , which may provide sufficient protection without the possibility of reverting back to the infectious form [12] . Understanding the potential economic and health benefits of a T . cruzi vaccine could help guide vaccine investment , development , targeting , and implementation , thereby assisting vaccine scientists , manufacturers , policy makers , and other decision makers . It can be helpful to construct economic models early in a vaccine's development , before key decisions about the vaccine are made and while important aspects of the vaccine can still be altered [14] . We developed a computer model to evaluate the economic value of a T . cruzi vaccine for the control of Chagas disease in Latin America . Different scenarios helped determine the effects of varying various key vaccine characteristics such as vaccine efficacy ( to guide development ) , vaccine cost ( to help set future price points ) , and risk of infection ( to identify appropriate target populations ) .\nWe constructed a Markov decision analytic computer simulation model to assess the potential cost-effectiveness of a T . cruzi vaccine in Latin America using TreeAge Pro 2009 ( TreeAge Software , Williamstown , Massachusetts ) . The model assumed the societal perspective and evaluated the economic value of vaccination versus no vaccination of a cohort of children <1 year of age to prevent T . cruzi infection and Chagas disease . Each cycle length was one year . Figure 1 illustrates the general model structure , including the following six Markov states of the disease model and an individual's possible transitions between states: All Markov states were mutually exclusive . Individuals entered the model at age 0 and began in the \u2018Susceptible/Well\u2019 state ( i . e . , well with no prior history of infection ) . Each passing year , the individual either remained in the same state or transitioned to another state . The individual continued in the model until he or she entered the Death state from ( 1 ) acute/symptomatic infection , ( 2 ) cardiomyopathy with or without CHF , or ( 3 ) mortality unrelated to T . cruzi infection , where they remained for the remainder of the trial [5] , [6] . Figure 2a\u2013e shows the possible paths an individual could have traveled through after entering each Markov state . After entering the \u2018Susceptible/Well\u2019 state , an individual had probabilities of becoming infected ( symptomatic or asymptomatic infection ) , dying of unrelated causes , or remaining uninfected . Only symptomatic cases had a probability of seeking T . cruzi treatment during the acute phase . Consistent with standard medical operating procedure , developing severe side effects resulted in discontinuation of drug treatment and therefore eliminating any chance the treatment could be successful . Asymptomatic cases did not receive treatment and proceeded directly to the indeterminate ( latent ) disease phase . The reported time from acute illness to development of chronic cardiac manifestations in the literature ranged from 10 to 30 years; infected individuals in the model therefore had to stay in the indeterminate phase for at least 10 cycles ( years ) before having an annual probability of developing cardiomyopathy ( with or without CHF ) [5] , [6] , [15] , [16] , [17] . Those who sought a form of treatment for chronic infection once continued to do so throughout the remainder of their life span . Each simulation run sent 1 , 000 individuals through the model 1 , 000 times each for a total of 1 , 000 , 000 individual realizations . For each simulation run , the following equation computed the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) , or cost per disability-adjusted life year ( DALY ) avoided , through vaccination:Quantification of DALY decrements for vaccinating and not vaccinating included the years lost due to disability from Chagas ( YLD ) as well as the years of life lost as a result of Chagas-related mortality ( YLL ) . Costs included both direct and indirect costs ( such as productivity loss ) that resulted from becoming a Chagas case . The cost-effectiveness of vaccination for each scenario was evaluated using the GDP per capita of Colombia ( $5 , 048 . 41 ) , as it represented the approximate average GDP per capita for all of Latin America [18] , [19] . Vaccination was considered highly cost-effective if the ICER value was $5 , 048 . 41 per DALY avoided or less . Scenarios that yielded an ICER of $15 , 145 . 23 per DALY ( 3 times the GDP per capita ) avoided or less still indicated that vaccination was cost-effective , while ICERs greater than 3 times the GDP per capita indicated that vaccination was not a cost-effective strategy . The cost of vaccinating an individual was calculated by comparing the average cost accrued on the vaccine arm of the model to the average cost accrued on the no vaccine arm over the 1 million trials for each simulation . The cost per avoided congestive heart failure ( CHF ) case was calculated by dividing the cost difference between the vaccine and no vaccine arm for the entire cohort by the total number of CHF cases avoided on the vaccine arm/branch ( compared to the no vaccine branch ) for the simulation . Table 1 shows the cost , probability , and DALY model input values and their corresponding sources . The probability of an acute case being symptomatic in the model was 1% . Based on a report of treatment-seeking behavior for febrile illness , the probability that a symptomatic individual sought treatment was 34% [5] , [8] , [20] . For treatment costs , life expectancy , and crude mortality rates , data from Colombia , where Chagas prevalence is high , served as a proxy for Latin America [19] . World Health Organization ( WHO ) sources provided disability weights for cardiomyopathy with and without CHF as well as crude mortality rates ( 0\u201311 mos , 1 . 65%; 1\u20134 yrs , 0 . 32%; 5\u20139 yrs , 0 . 15%; 10\u201314 yrs , 0 . 18%; 15\u201319 yrs , 0 . 55%; 20\u201324 yrs , 0 . 97%; 25\u201329 yrs , 1 . 08%; 30\u201334 yrs , 1 . 02%; 35\u201339 yrs , 1 . 02%; 40\u201344 yrs , 1 . 12%; 45\u201349 yrs , 1 . 58%; 50\u201354 yrs , 2 . 11%; 55\u201359 yrs , 3 . 12%; 60\u201364 yrs , 4 . 99%; 65\u201369 yrs , 9 . 07%; 70\u201374 yrs , 14 . 66%; 75\u201379 yrs , 23 . 85%; 80\u201384 yrs , 30 . 62%; 85\u201389 yrs , 40 . 46%; 90\u201394 yrs , 51 . 70%; 95\u201399 yrs , 64 . 50%; 100 yrs and older , 100% ) and life expectancies ( 0\u201311 mos , 75 . 5 yrs; 1\u20134 yrs , 75 . 8 yrs; 5\u20139 yrs , 72 yrs; 10\u201314 yrs , 67 . 1 yrs; 15\u201319 yrs , 62 . 2 yrs; 20\u201324 yrs , 57 . 5 yrs; 25\u201329 yrs , 53 . 1 yrs; 30\u201334 yrs , 48 . 6 yrs; 35\u201339 yrs , 44 . 1 yrs; 40\u201344 yrs , 39 . 5 yrs; 45\u201349 yrs , 35 yrs; 50\u201354 yrs , 30 . 4 yrs; 55\u201359 yrs , 26 yrs; 60\u201364 yrs , 21 . 8 yrs; 65\u201369 yrs , 17 . 8 yrs; 70\u201374 yrs , 14 . 3 yrs; 75\u201379 yrs , 11 . 4 yrs; 80\u201384 yrs , 9 . 2 yrs; 85\u201389 yrs , 7 . 1 yrs; 90\u201394 yrs , 5 . 2 yrs; 95\u201399 yrs , 3 . 6 yrs; 100 yrs and older , 2 . 5yrs ) [21] , [22] . Sensitivity analyses evaluated the impact of varying key model parameters such as vaccine cost ( ranging from a low of $0 . 50 up to the cost at which the vaccine was no longer cost-effective ) , vaccine efficacy in preventing infection ( range: 25% to 75% ) , the cost of acute-phase drug treatment ( range: $10\u2013$150 to account for variations in acute-phase treatment regimens ) , and risk of infection ( range: 1%\u201320% ) [23] . As many studies report a cost associated with routine surveillance ( i . e . , clinic visits , radiographs , electrocardiograms , and laboratory tests ) during the indeterminate phase , additional sensitivity analyses varied the probability that an individual accrued a cost while in this phase from 25%\u201375% [6] , [24] . Probabilistic sensitivity analyses determined the effects of simultaneously varying parameter values across their respective ranges .\nResults suggest that a T . cruzi vaccine would be cost-effective across a wide range of vaccine prices and efficacies and T . cruzi infection risks . In fact , in many cases , a T . cruzi vaccine could actually save costs ( i . e . , that would be associated with treating the disease ) in addition to providing health benefits . Vaccination remained cost-effective even up to a vaccine price of $75 when infection risk was 5% and vaccine efficacy was greater than 50% and up to a vaccine price of $200 when the vaccine efficacy was 75% or greater . The majority of our modeled scenarios demonstrated vaccination to be very cost-effective , and in many cases highly cost-effective , especially with lower vaccine price points , compared to no vaccination . Table 2 indicates the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) of Chagas vaccination at various vaccine costs , infection risks and vaccine efficacy rates . When the total vaccine cost was less than $5 , vaccination was highly cost-effective across all scenarios of infection risk ( 1% , 5% , 10% and 20% ) and vaccine efficacy ( 25% , 50% , and 75% ) . Increasing the vaccine price to $10 alters the vaccine strategy to cost-effective across all scenarios , and finally when the vaccine cost is $20 and vaccine efficacy is 25% , some scenarios become cost-ineffective . However , when the vaccine efficacy is greater than 50% , vaccination remains cost-effective until a $50 vaccine price point at 1% infection rate , a $75 vaccine price point at 5% infection rate , and a $100 vaccine price point at 10% infection rate . Vaccination remains cost-effective at a $200 price point when the efficacy is greater than 50% and infection risk is 20% . The model was fairly robust and displayed minimal sensitivity to variation in treatment costs for acute infection and the probability of an indeterminate phase-associated cost . Table 3 shows that vaccinating an individual can actually be cost savings under many explored circumstances . Negative values in the table indicate that vaccinating an individual resulted in cost savings ( i . e . , there was actually net monetary gain from vaccinating an individual ) . For example , when a $1 vaccine was only 25% efficacious and the risk of infection was 1% , vaccinating an individual would on average save $1 . 52 . At infection rates as low as 1% , vaccination was cost-saving up to a $5 vaccine price point as long as the vaccine remained at least 50% efficacious , with savings overall ranging from \u2212$0 . 07 to \u2212$81 . 26 per vaccinated individual . Vaccination remained cost-saving for all scenarios under a $10 vaccine price point , when the risk of infection was 5% or greater , averting the most cost ( \u2212$81 ) per vaccinee when vaccine price was $1 , efficacy was 75% , and infection risk was 20% . Administering vaccine only resulted in net cost ( $2 . 44\u2013$7 . 26 ) at low infection risk ( 1% ) and vaccine price point of $10 for the entire range of evaluated vaccine efficacies . The cost benefit persisted when the vaccine efficacy was 50% at vaccine costs of $20\u2013$30 when infection risk was greater of equal to 10% . When the vaccine was 75% efficacious , a cost savings exists for vaccine prices of \u2264$50 . For a vaccine cost of $200 , the incremental cost of vaccinating an individual ranged from $111 . 03 ( 20% infection rate , 75% vaccine efficacy ) to $197 . 36 ( 1% infection rate , 25% vaccine efficacy ) . Table 4 displays the cost per CHF case averted by vaccination . As can be seen , since the vaccine in most cases is cost savings , there is actually net savings per CHF case averted . The greatest cost savings per CHF case avoided were seen at the lowest vaccine cost ( $1 ) and the lowest infection rates ( 1% ) . Under every scenario with a vaccine cost of \u2264$10 ( regardless of indeterminate phase-cost association or vaccine efficacy ) and infection rates of 5% or above , the cost per CHF case averted was negative , indicating a cost savings per case avoided through vaccination . When infection rates were 1% and vaccine cost increased to $10 , the cost per avoided CHF case was $50 , 883 at 75% vaccine efficacy . At lower efficacies ( 50% and 25% ) , cost per CHF case averted increased to $126 , 009 and $660 , 350 , respectively . At a vaccine price point of $5 , vaccinating to prevent a case of CHF ranged from costing over $100 , 000 to saving over $100 , 000 , depending on vaccine efficacy .\nAll computer models are simplifications of real world scenarios and therefore cannot capture all possible outcomes of Chagas disease or the efficacy of concurrent existing regional control methods . Our model focuses on the individual rather than a population and therefore , does not explicitly represent herd immunity . However , increasing herd immunity could decrease Chagas risk , and our study demonstrates how changes in Chagas disease risk would affect the vaccine's economic value . Additionally , this model cannot account for the variation in high risk exposure resulting from factors such as environmental conditions or individual behaviors across Latin America . Although model assumptions and data inputs were drawn from an extensive review of the literature , sources may vary in quality and input values may not hold under all conditions . Our model suggests that introducing a T . cruzi vaccine to Latin America would provide economic value . Such a vaccine could be highly cost-effective and many cases could be economically dominant , providing both cost savings and health benefits . Even a vaccine with fairly low efficacy ( 25% ) can provide cost savings . Moreover , a vaccine could be cost-effective even at relatively low infection risks ( 1% ) . Such findings support continued efforts to develop a human vaccine against T . cruzi to help reduce the significant burden of Chagas disease .", "output": " Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a leading cause of heart disease worldwide, with a significant impact on Latin America.

{"input": "Mass drug administration ( MDA ) using praziquantel is the WHO-recommended approach for control of schistosomiasis . However , few studies have compared the impact of different schedules of MDA on the resultant infection levels . We wished to evaluate whether annual MDA was more effective than less frequent treatments for reducing community-level prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infections . We performed a cluster randomized trial ( ISRCTN 14849830 ) of 3 different MDA frequencies over a 5 year period in 75 villages with moderate ( 10%-24% ) initial prevalence of S . mansoni in school children in western Kenya . Praziquantel was distributed by school teachers to students either annually , the first 2 years , or every other year over a 4 year period . Prevalence and intensity of infection were measured by stool examination in 9\u201312 year old students using the Kato-Katz method at baseline , each treatment year , and for the final evaluation at year 5 . S . mansoni prevalence and intensity were also measured in first year students at baseline and year 5 . Twenty-five schools were randomly assigned to each arm . S . mansoni prevalence and infection intensity in 9\u201312 year old students significantly decreased within each arm from baseline to year 5 but there were no differences between arms . There were no differences in infection levels in first year students either within or between arms . Strategies employing 2 or 4 rounds of MDA had a similar impact in schools with moderate initial prevalence , suggesting that schistosomiasis control can be sustained by school-based MDA , even if provided only every other year .\nPassage of World Health Assembly ( WHA ) resolution 54 . 19 helped stimulate increased efforts , resources , and research to control morbidity caused by schistosomiasis . The main approach for schistosomiasis control recommended by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) is mass drug administration ( MDA ) using praziquantel [1 , 2] . Praziquantel has been used successfully over the past 30 years in many countries and is appropriate for MDA as it is inexpensive , well-tolerated , and safe in persons who are not infected [3] . The current WHO guidelines for schistosomiasis MDA suggest different strategies based on prevalence of infection in school-age children ( SAC ) [1 , 2] . Communities with < 10% egg positive individuals among SAC are considered at low risk for morbidity caused by schistosomiasis; the recommended action is two treatments during primary school . Communities with SAC egg positive prevalence between 10% and 50% are considered moderate risk and every other year MDA is recommended . High risk communities are those with > 50% egg positive SAC and annual MDA is recommended . Both SAC in and out of school are targeted and treatment is also recommended for adults with high likelihood of infection in moderate and high risk communities . These guidelines were developed with the primary goal of preventing severe morbidity associated with high-intensity infections and at a time when the supply of praziquantel was much more restricted than it is currently . In recent years , there has been a growing recognition of an association of morbidity even with low intensity infections and a more than six-fold increase in donation of praziquantel tablets by pharmaceutical companies and purchases by bilateral organizations [4 , 5] . This has led to a similar increase in the number of people treated for schistosomiasis , with more than 66 million people treated for schistosomiasis in 2015 , the vast majority in sub-Saharan Africa . However , even with increased donations , far fewer treatments are available than the number of people who are in need [5] . Thus , judicious distribution is warranted both in terms of the drug supply and the other costs associated with the logistics to deliver an MDA program . In response to these considerations , the Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation ( SCORE ) was formed in 2008 to address the needs of schistosomiasis control programs [6] . The emphasis of several SCORE projects was to provide an evidence base for program decisions related to MDA with praziquantel for Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium in areas with different levels of initial infection prevalence . This paper describes the results of different frequencies and timing of school-based MDA in villages in western Kenya with moderate ( 10% to 24% ) initial prevalence of S . mansoni infection . Because WHO guidelines for interventions are based on community level infections in SAC [1 , 2] , we used a cluster randomized trial design to evaluate the impact of the different interventions on school-level prevalence and intensity of infection .\nThe study was conducted in Nyanza Province in 7 districts bordering Lake Victoria . This area was chosen based upon previous studies demonstrating schistosomiasis prevalence in the moderate range and in consultation with the Provincial Public Health Officer and with approval from the Ministry of Health . The area is semi-arid and bisected by the equator . Temperatures are reasonably consistent throughout the year . Over 96% of the population in these districts belongs to the Luo ethnic group . We have previously demonstrated an inverse relationship between community distance from Lake Victoria and S . mansoni infection prevalence , suggesting that most schistosomiasis transmission in the area occurs through contact with the lake waters [7 , 8] . No prior MDA with praziquantel had been attempted in any of the schools or communities in the study . The study was approved by the Scientific Steering and Ethical Review Committees ( ERC ) of the Kenya Medical Research Institute ( KEMRI ) ; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention institutional review board ( IRB ) relied on the KEMRI review . The IRB of the University of Georgia also administratively reviewed and approved the study . Written permission was obtained from the parents or guardians of children participating in the study . Informed assent was obtained from study participants less than 18 years of age . The trial is number 14849830 registered at ISRCTN . Protocols for SCORE randomized cluster studies to evaluate different MDA approaches including this project were developed during protocol harmonization meetings as previously described in detail [6] . In brief , an eligibility survey was conducted among 13\u201314 year old school children to identify villages with 10\u201324% initial prevalence of S . mansoni infection . One stool sample was collected from each of the 50 children participating per school , from which two Kato-Katz thick smears were prepared and examined microscopically to estimate infection prevalence . The number of schools per intervention arm and the number of children per school selected were based on an expected prevalence difference of 9 . 4% at the conclusion of the study [6] . Based on this power calculation , 75 primary schools in the appropriate prevalence range were identified by the study investigators and randomized into 3 study arms with 25 schools each using a simple random allocation program in SAS ( Fig 1 ) [6] . For all study arms , baseline infection prevalence was determined for 9\u201312 year old children by sampling a target of 100 children per school . If more than 100 children in this age range were enrolled in a school , 100 children were randomly selected from the total eligible enrollment list . Three consecutive stool samples were sought from each participant , two Kato-Katz slides were prepared from each stool , and the number of schistosome eggs was counted on each slide . To compare effects of MDA on force of transmission , a single stool for preparation of two Kato Katz slides was also sought from up to 100 students in their first year of school . These children were typically between 5 and 8 years old . Following baseline assessment of 9\u201312 year old children and first year students , praziquantel MDA ( 40mg/kg ) was provided to all children in all 75 primary schools and administered by school health teachers who had been trained to use the praziquantel dose pole and recognize adverse responses to treatment . In the second year of the study , 9\u201312 year old children in schools in Arms 1 and 2 were assessed as at baseline ( target of three stools , two slides per stool , for 100 children ) and provided MDA . In year 3 , 9\u201312 year old children in schools in Arms 1 and 3 were assessed and provided MDA . In year 4 , only children in schools in Arm 1 were assessed and provided MDA . In year 5 , 9\u201312 year old children in all schools were assessed in a final evaluation . In addition at year 5 , 100 first year students per school were sought to provide a single stool for two Kato-Katz slides . Thus , children in schools in Arm 1 were assessed and provided MDA for each of 4 years with a final evaluation at year 5; children in schools in Arm 2 were assessed and provided MDA for the first 2 years and evaluated at year 5; and children in Arm 3 were assessed and provided MDA in years 1 and 3 with the final evaluation in year 5 ( Fig 1 ) . Treatment coverage was estimated for each school in each year by comparing the number of children treated to the number of children enrolled in school , with a minimum coverage target of 90% . Primary school education in Kenya is free and the government has decreed it unlawful for children of the appropriate age to not be enrolled in school . Therefore , we considered the school enrollment records to be an accurate representation of the number of SAC in the community . The school health teacher administered the praziquantel and the individual class teacher recorded which students had been treated so that an accurate accounting of coverage was maintained . Latitude and longitude coordinates were obtained at each school using Global Positioning System on Android phones and projected to UTM zone 36S for maps . Map was created with ArcGIS ( version 10 . 3 , ESRI , Inc . , Redlands , CA ) . Parental permission and participant assent were obtained each sampling year . Study participants were assigned a unique identification number that was used to track all data using barcodes . Age , sex and village data were entered for participants using their unique identifier on Android phones . Stool cups with barcode labels were provided to the children in the morning and were returned before lunch . While stools on 3 consecutive days were sought from each 9\u201312 year old participant at each year they were assessed , it was not possible to get 3 stool samples from every child . Thus , infection intensity was determined based on the number of Kato-Katz slides ( up to 6 ) available for each child . Android phones were used to read the barcode and the egg data were entered using EpiCollect [9] . If a child had at least 1 egg on any of the slides , he or she was considered positive for infection . Because the Kato-Katz method analyzes 41 mg of stool per slide , raw egg counts were multiplied by 24 to estimate the eggs per gram ( epg ) of feces . Infected children with an average epg <100 were considered to have light infections , 100\u2013399 epg had moderate infections , and those with \u2265400 epg had heavy infections according to WHO guidelines [1 , 2] . Egg counts were truncated at 1008 epg . Mean prevalence and intensity summary statistics by study arm and year accounted for village-level clustering via Taylor series linearization [10] . Changes over time and comparisons between arms were performed with negative binomial regression with generalized estimating equations ( GEE ) [11] . Communities at each year were the clustering factor and an exchangeable correlation structure was used . Adjusted models controlled for age and sex and were weighted by the inverse of the village sample size . Modeling results are reported as a prevalence ratio ( PR ) or arithmetic mean ratio ( AMR ) . Because baseline intensity levels varied slightly , our main analyses assessed the changes over time . Thus , analyses of the changes over time compared the ratios of differences between the start and end of study in prevalence or intensity for each arm . Interclass correlation coefficients and design effects were calculated using mixed models [12 , 13] . All analyses used the 5% level of significance .\nFig 2 is a map of the 75 schools included in the study and shows the distribution of schools included in each of the study arms . The eligibility study was performed in 2010 , with randomization of schools to arms and initiation of MDA in 2011; the study was completed in 2015 . At baseline ( year 1 ) , the overall mean prevalence and infection intensity distributions ( Fig 3 ) as well as the mean intensities of infection ( Table 1 ) were similar among the three arms , suggesting that the randomization was effective . Between year 1 and year 5 ( Table 2 ) , there was a significant reduction in prevalence for all three arms ( p \u2264 0 . 003 ) and intensity for arms 1 ( p = 0 . 004 ) and 3 ( p < 0 . 001 ) , but not for arm 2 ( p = 0 . 11 ) . Interestingly , the largest drop for both prevalence and intensity in arm 1 was between years 1 and 2 , corresponding to the first treatment , with subsequent years showing either no or relatively marginal further decreases ( Fig 3 , S1 Table ) . By contrast , the reductions in prevalence and intensity for arms 2 and 3 were more progressive . There were no statistically significant differences in the prevalence between arms at year 5 and the only significant difference in infection intensity was between arms 2 and 3 , both of which had received 2 rounds of MDA ( Table 3 ) . The relative changes from baseline to year 5 were also not statistically different between arms ( S2 Table ) , again suggesting that the different MDA regimens had a similar impact . Throughout the study , we were unable to achieve our target enrollment of 2500 per arm for any arm in any year . At baseline , enrollment per arm ranged between 1456 and 1678 . Participation improved each year ( S1 Table ) , with 2304 to 2486 children per arm enrolled in the final evaluation ( Table 1 ) . The intracluster correlation coefficient ( 95% CI ) was 0 . 13 ( 0 . 09 , 0 . 16 ) for prevalence and 0 . 01 ( 0 . 00 , 0 . 02 ) for intensity . We observed a higher than expected design effect for the prevalence analysis ( 10 . 89 , 95% CI 8 . 18\u201313 . 59 ) . The design effect was not as pronounced for the analyses of infection intensity ( 2 . 07 , 1 . 48\u20132 . 66 ) . Since the assumed design effect in the power analyses was 2 , the trial was severely underpowered to find differences in prevalence but was adequate for finding differences in infection intensity . Treatment coverage was monitored to ensure that relative effects of MDA regimens were not influenced by differences in the proportion of individuals receiving treatment . Mean coverage did not differ by arm or by year for schools scheduled to receive MDA that year ( Table 4 ) . While some schools in each arm did not achieve the target of 90% of students receiving treatment in a given year , there were only two schools ( one in arm 1 and one in arm 3 ) that did not have at least 90% coverage in more than one treatment year . Prevalence and intensity of infection were also measured in first year students at baseline and year 5 ( Table 5 ) . Because pre-school children were not included in the school-based MDA , any differences in first year student infection levels might suggest changes in environmental exposure or force of transmission . There were no statistically significant differences between arms at the two time points first year student infections were measured . There were also no differences between years 1 and 5 within a given arm , suggesting that children had similar risk for infection at both time points .\nIn a cluster randomized trial , we evaluated different frequencies and timing of school-based MDA on infection levels among 9\u201312 year old children living in communities with moderate initial prevalence S . mansoni infections . We found significant decreases in prevalence of infection over time within all arms and significant decreases in intensity of infection within the arms that received treatment every year or every other year . However , four treatments did not result in significantly lower prevalence or intensities of infection compared to treatment every other year over a 5 year period . These data suggest that biennial treatment may have similar benefits as annual treatment in schistosomiasis control programs in moderate prevalence areas , making it possible to provide MDA to twice as many schools with the same resources as using annual MDA . However , we observed that for all arms it was only possible to reduce prevalence to approximately half of initial prevalence , regardless of whether two or four rounds of MDA were provided . This is consistent with the proposition that MDA alone , while able to sustain morbidity control , will not be sufficient to effect schistosomiasis elimination and will need supplementation with other control measures such as improved water and sanitation systems , snail control , or immunization if an effective vaccine one day becomes available [14] . However , it was possible to transition communities in arms 1 and 3 from the WHO-defined \u201cmoderate-risk\u201d category to \u201clow risk\u201d ( average infection levels < 10% prevalence ) using school based MDA alone although there was a small number of children in some villages that still had high intensity infections at year 5 . In the final evaluation in year 5 , first year students , who were not in school in any previous years and therefore would never have received MDA , had similar prevalence and infection intensity levels as the first year students at the study baseline . This result suggests that at this level of infection in the community , the school based MDA did not influence the force of transmission of schistosomiasis to which these children were exposed . The main limitation of this study was a failure to achieve the target sample size for monitoring infections in either 9\u201312 year olds or first year students . A total of 2500 students was targeted but never reached in any arm in any year . Sampling in the final evaluation came the closest ( 2304 to 2486 students per arm ) but none of the arms in the baseline sampling year enrolled more than 1700 children . The sample size we achieved for first year students was even worse with only 474 to 732 children tested for any of the first year student the time points . This failure to achieve the targeted sample sizes was primarily a function of lower than anticipated SAC populations rather than refusal of any subgroup to participate or children not attending school in these communities . However , because the sampling unit was the school , which remained 25 for all time points and arms , we do not believe that the lower than anticipated number of participants would have reduced the probability of detecting a difference when a true difference existed , although it could have decreased the precision of the results and contributed to the unanticipatedly large design effect that we observed . Despite not achieving our targeted sample sizes , this study is the largest randomized trial comparing schistosomiasis MDA regimens to date . Another possible limitation is that while these studies were being performed , a parallel study of school-based and community-wide MDA was being conducted in communities with higher initial prevalence ( >25% infection among school children ) in the same districts ( manuscript in preparation ) . Most of the communities in the other study were closer to Lake Victoria as there is a direct relationship between prevalence and proximity to the lake [7 , 8] . Thus , it is possible that MDA in communities between the lake and the schools described in this study could have affected how students in the schools described here were exposed . However , the similarity of infection levels in first year students at baseline and final evaluation argues against the parallel study confounding these results . In conclusion , school-based MDA with praziquantel was effective at reducing schistosomiasis prevalence in 9\u201312 year old Kenyan school children from \u201cmoderate-risk\u201d to \u201clow-risk\u201d according to current WHO guidelines designed to prevent severe morbidity [1 , 2] . Biennial treatment appeared as effective as annual treatment to accomplishing this reduction while 2 rounds of treatment followed by 2 years without treatment was slightly less effective . However , the data also suggest that MDA alone is unlikely to allow countries to achieve the elimination goals set forth by WHA resolution 65 . 21 . Nevertheless , we anticipate that the results from this and the other SCORE MDA studies for gaining and sustaining control will contribute to the evidence base for development of new guidelines that will be useful for schistosomiasis control and elimination and assist NTD program managers to allocate resources according to their goals .", "output": "**Reducing Schistosomiasis Infections in Kenyan School Children: A Study on Mass Drug Administration**\n\nSchistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that affects millions of people worldwide, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends mass drug administration (MDA) using praziquantel as the primary approach to control the disease. However, the frequency of MDA treatments has been a topic of debate. A recent study in western Kenya aimed to evaluate the impact of different MDA schedules on reducing schistosomiasis infections in school children.\n\n**Background**\n\nSchistosomiasis is a significant public health problem in Kenya, with many communities having moderate to high levels of infection. The WHO guidelines recommend different MDA strategies based on the prevalence of infection in school-age children. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of different MDA frequencies in reducing infection levels.\n\n**Methods**\n\nThe study was conducted in 75 primary schools in western Kenya, with 25 schools randomly assigned to each of three MDA arms. The arms received either annual MDA, MDA every other year, or two rounds of MDA followed by two years without treatment. The study lasted for five years, with stool examinations conducted at baseline, each treatment year, and at the final evaluation.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\nThe study found that all three MDA arms significantly reduced the prevalence and intensity of schistosomiasis infections in 9-12 year old school children. However, there were no significant differences in infection levels between the arms, suggesting that biennial treatment may be as effective as annual treatment in reducing infection levels. The study also found that MDA alone may not be sufficient to eliminate schistosomiasis, and that other control measures such as improved water and sanitation systems, snail control, or immunization may be necessary.\n\n**Significance**\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for schistosomiasis control programs in Kenya and other countries. The results suggest that biennial treatment may be a more cost-effective and sustainable approach to reducing infection levels, allowing for more schools to be treated with the same resources. However, the study also highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to schistosomiasis control, including improved water and sanitation systems, snail control, and immunization.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of school-based MDA in reducing schistosomiasis infections in Kenyan school children. The findings suggest that biennial treatment may be a viable alternative to annual treatment, and that MDA alone may not be sufficient to eliminate the disease. The study's results contribute to the evidence base for schistosomiasis control and elimination, and will inform the development of new guidelines for NTD program managers.", "topic": "Schistosomiasis", "cat": []}
{"input": "The functioning of living cells requires efficient and selective transport of materials into and out of the cell , and between different cellular compartments . Much of this transport occurs through nano-scale channels that do not require large scale molecular re-arrangements ( such as transition from a \u2018closed\u2019 to an \u2018open\u2019 state ) and do not require a direct input of metabolic energy during transport . Nevertheless , these \u2018always open\u2019 channels are highly selective and pass only their cognate molecules , while efficiently excluding all others; indeed , these channels can efficiently transport specific molecules even in the presence of a vast excess of non-specific molecules . Such biological transporters have inspired the creation of artificial nano-channels . These channels can be used as nano-molecular sorters , and can also serve as testbeds for examining modes of biological transport . In this paper , we propose a simple kinetic mechanism that explains how the selectivity of such \u2018always open\u2019 channels can be based on the exclusion of non-specific molecules by specific ones , due to the competition for limited space inside the channel . The predictions of the theory account for the behavior of the nuclear pore complex and of artificial nanopores that mimic its function . This theory provides the basis for future work aimed at understanding the selectivity of various biological transport phenomena .\nLiving cells require the efficient and selective trafficking of molecules through various transport channels [1] , [2] . Some transporters require large conformational changes , involving transitions from \u2018closed\u2019 to \u2018open\u2019 states and a direct input of metabolic energy during transport [1] . However , many other transporters provide efficient and selective transport without large conformational changes and without a direct input of metabolic energy during transport . Examples of the latter transport mechanisms include selective permeability of porins [3]\u2013[8] , transport through the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) [9]\u2013[13] , and the access of ligands to the active sites of certain enzymes [14] . In the context of transport through the NPC , such a mode of transport has been termed \u2018virtual gating\u2019 [12] , [15] . Ion channels also belong to this class of transporters , although factors specific to ion channels set them beyond the scope of the present work [16] . Recently , artificial molecular nano-channel devices have been built that mimic and utilize the principles upon which the function of natural transporters is based [17]\u2013[24] . In this paper , we focus on an artificial nano-molecular channel that mimics the functioning of the NPC [23] , as the mimic provides important insights into the function of the underlying biological channel . Despite their variety , such natural and artificial transporters appear to share common mechanisms of transport selectivity and efficiency . They commonly include a channel or a passageway , through which molecules translocate by diffusion [2]\u2013[24] . Often , selective transport involves transient interactions of the transported molecules with corresponding receptors inside the channel [2]\u2013[24] , which leads to transient trapping of the transported molecules in the channel . The selectivity mechanisms of such channels are still a matter of debate . A crucial insight is that the channel geometry , even in the absence of any physical barrier for particle entrance , the probability of a particle to transolcate through a channel is low [25] , [26] . Transient trapping increases the probability of transport of individual molecules and thus enhances the transport . Related effects arise in selective membrane transport , known as \u2018facilitated diffusion\u2019 in that context [2] , [15] , [25]\u2013[32] . However , if molecules spend too much time in the channel , the rate at which they leave the channel is lower than the rate at which they attempt to enter - which leads to jamming and a decrease of transport . Hence , transport efficiency can be optimized by tuning the interaction strength of the transported molecules with the channel . The selectivity of such channels can thus be based on the differences in the trapping times of the optimally interacting molecules compared to others [5] , [15] , [31] , [33]\u2013[37] . It is important to emphasize that the efficiency and selectivity of transport are determined not by the equilibrium interaction strength of the molecules with the channel per se , but by the rates at which the molecules enter , translocate through , and exit from the transport channel [15] , [34] , [36] , [37] . These rates are in many cases determined by the strength of the interactions with the transport device , but can be also determined by its geometry [2]\u2013[23] . For instance , the trapping times inside a channel can be limited by diffusion through convoluted passages inside the channel ( e . g . in zeolites ) , known as \u2018entropic trapping\u2019 [38]\u2013[41] . Theories based on these ideas provide an adequate explanation of transport selectivity of artificial nano-channels for single species transport ( for instance , [42] ) . However , in nature ( and in order to be useful in many technological applications such as molecular sorters ) the selected molecules have to be transported through a channel in a vast background of other molecules , many of which can interact weakly and non-specifically with the transport channel . Thus , transport channels have to be able to constantly select their cognate molecules from such a background . It is still not clear precisely how biological and artificial channels can perform selective transport under such conditions , but any useful theoretical description must take into account this non- specific competition . It is likely that various mechanisms can contribute to selectivity . For instance , in some cases , the selectivity arises from the presense of a physical or energetic barrier for the entrance of non-specific molecules into the channel [27]\u2013[29] . In this paper we focus on the universal selectivity properties of channels , which do not depend on the specific molecular details pertinent to each specific transporter . We show that highly selective transport is possible in the presence of non-specific competition even when the non-specific molecules are free to interact with and enter into the channel . We study the case of a mixture of two molecular species of different trapping strenghts attempting to traverse the channel . Our model relies on only two essential ingredients: transient trapping of the molecules in the channel and inter-molecular competition for the limited space inside the channel . Analysis of the model reveals a novel kinetic mechanism of the enhancement of transport selectivity through narrow channels , which relies on the sequential exclusion of weakly trapped ( low affinity ) non-specific molecules from the channel due to competition with strongly trapped ( high affinity ) cognate molecules that spend a longer time in the channel . Comparison of the theoretical predictions with experimental data shows that the predicted mechanism accounts for the transport selectivity observed in an artificial nano-channel that mimics the NPC . Due to its generality , the proposed mechanism of selectivity is expected to play a role in various biological and artificial nano-channels .\nLet us first consider a \u2018one-site\u2019 channel model ( Fig . 1 ) . All the details of the potentially complicated kinetics of transport through the channel are absorbed into the forward and backward exit rates and . These exit rates can be thought of as \u2018off\u2019 rates for the release of the particles from the channel . Particles of two different species ( denoted as n and m ) attempt to enter the channel from the left ( Fig . 1 ) . Particles of species enter the channel with the rate if the channel is unoccupied , exit at the right end with the rate , or return to the left side with the rate . The respective rates for the other species , particles of type , are , and ( Fig . 1 ) . The channel can be in three states: occupied by an -species particle , occupied by an -species particle , or un-occupied , with the respective probabilities , , and . This scheme explicitly allows only one particle of any type to be present in the channel at any time . In other words , if the channel is occupied by a particle of either species , other particles cannot enter until the residing particle hops out . Note the parallel between transport through such one-site channel and the Michaelis-Menten kinetics of enzymatic reactions \u2013 the channel is analogous to the enzyme molecule , while the transported particles are analogous to the substrates . The master equation describing the kinetics of transport through the channel is [2] , [43] : ( 1 ) Note that , ( so that ) because the channel has to be in some state . Transmitted fluxes to the right of the particles of each type are and , respectively . Solving equations ( 1 ) , we get: ( 2 ) We define the efficiency of transport as the ratio of the transmitted flux to the impinging flux , . However , not all the particles that attempt to enter the channel succeed , because the channel is occupied with the probability . The transport efficiency is thus different from the translocation probability of a particle that has entered the channel to exit on the right - a fact that will become important below . Mathematically , the translocation probability is defined as . From eq . ( 2 ) , in the absence of competition , when particles of only one type are present ( say ) , in the limit of small currents ( when ) , the efficiency and the probability are identical and equal to . In the case when both particle species are competing for space in the channel , from equation ( 2 ) , the ratio of transport efficiencies of m-species and n-species is ( 3 ) Thus , the transport efficiency of the particles of each type through a single-site channel is not influenced by the presence of particles of the other type . As we show below this is not so for channels that can accommodate more than one particle . Selectivity conditions change when one considers transport in a mixture of two different species of molecules in longer channels , where the molecules can interfere with each other's passage through the channel . The main result is that in the presence of more strongly trapped species , the transport of more weakly trapped species is strongly inhibited , compared to the case when they are present alone . We now turn to comparison of the theoretical predictions with recent experiments on transport through artificial nano-channels that mimic NPC function [23] , where many of the parameters discussed above can be varied experimentally . In these experiments , the channels were functionalized with natively unfolded proteins that naturally line the passageway of the NPC ( commonly known as the FG-nups ) . These proteins bind strongly ( although transiently ) and specifically to nuclear transport factors , but weakly and non-specifically ( or not at all ) to other proteins ( see Fig . 8A ) . Here we confine ourselves to qualitative comparison with the experiments , to establish the basic mechanisms of selectivity that operate in such channels ( Fig . 8B ) . More quantitative comparisons require more detailed understanding of the local binding-unbinding kinetics of the multiple binding sites on the transport factors to unfolded filamentous proteins within the NPC , as well as realistic modeling of the dynamics of the filaments themselves [59]\u2013[62] . At this stage , the understanding of the mechanistic details of the interactions of the transport factors with the FG-nups and of the movement of the transport factors from one FG-nup to the next is lacking . Jovanovic-Talisman et al . [23] investigated the transport of various nuclear transport factors and of non-specific \u201ccontrol\u201d proteins such as bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) through the artificial channels described above , and compared the fluxes when they are present either separately or in mixtures . A subset of the experimental results of [23] , where the GST tagged nuclear transport factor 2 ( NTF2-GST ) and BSA were compared , issummarized in Fig . 8C . It was observed that the transport of non-binding control protein ( BSA ) was inhibited by the presence of NTF2-GST , in accord with the theoretical predictions ( above ) . Likewise , the magnitude of the inhibition increased with the length of the trapping region and decreased with the channel width , in accord with the theortical predictions . Thus , the mechanism proposed in this paper account for the experimental results and indicates that selective nano-filters can be built relatively simply , using just the basic stochastic kinetics of the transport process and competition for space inside the channel .\nIn nature , transport channels have to select for their cognate cargoes over a vast background of other species that might interact with the channel non-specifically . How can they maintain selective transport in such conditions ? It is likely that many different mechanisms of selectivity may be operational in such channels [24] , [61]\u2013[64] . Here , we have studied a minimal kinetic mechanism of selectivity enhancement , which relies only on the inherent properties of stochastic transport through narrow channels . The model includes only two essential ingredients: transient trapping of the particles inside the channel , and the competition for the limited space inside the channel . The model predicts that weakly trapped ( non-specific ) species are effectively excluded from transport through the channel by competition with strongly trapped cognate cargoes that spend more time in the channel . In a mixture of two different species - one that is transiently trapped in the channel longer than the other - the transport of the particles of the more weakly trapped species is strongly inhibited compared to the case when they are present alone . Moreover , the theory predicts that transport of the more strongly trapped species is enhanced by the presence of the non-specific competitors . These effects are described in Figs . 4 and 7 . In the main , inhibition of non-specific competitor transport is not due to prevention of entrance into the channel . Rather , this inhibition is largely due to the diminished probability of translocating through the channel ( and so the increased probability of returning to the entrance compartment ) after the particle has entered the channel . Remarkably , the transport of non-specific particles is inhibited even if their flux greatly exceeds that of the specifically binding particles . This selectivity enhancement is a purely kinetic , non-equilibrium mechanism . Notably , it does not require input of metabolic energy [1] , [65]\u2013[67] , but rather stems from the inherent properties of the stochastic transport process . Thus , this effect is expected to hold for various molecular mechanisms of transport through the channels , channel widths , and particle sizes . Even in channels where other effects may be dominant , the effect described here is likely to play a role . It is important to emphasize that for the purposes of the present theory , it is immaterial as to which physical mechanism determines the rate of \u201chopping\u201d through the channel and the escape rates \u2013 i . e . , whether they are determined by the binding energies of the particles inside the channel ( as in ion channels or porins ) [33] , [36] , [37] , [43] , geometrical effects such as entropic trapping [38]\u2013[41] , or a mixture of the two ( e . g . during transport through the nuclear pore complex and artificial nano-channels [8]\u2013[12] , [17]\u2013[24] ) . Predictions of our theory are in agreement with recent experiments on transport through artificial nano-channels that mimic the nuclear pore complex function [23] - Fig . 8 . Thus , both theory and experiment emphasize the need to always consider non-specific competition when studying transport selectivity of both biological and artificial nano-channels . They also highlight the role that the specifc molecules play in the selectivity \u2013 they can be viewed as an essential part of the selectivity mechanism . In their absence , it is possible that the channel can be essentially non-selective and can pass various non-specific molecules; it is the presence of the specific molecules that makes the transport selective . The theory also makes verifiable predictions on how the addition of non-specific molecules affects the transport of the specific ones . We expect that future comparison of the theory with experimental data will lead to further refinements of the theory and elucidation of additional selectivity mechanisms , thus allowing the design of more selective artificial nano-channels . Future questions include the mutual influence between the fluxes of particle species in multi-species case , as well as more detailed modeling of the diffusion of the transport factors through the layer of the FG-nups ( in the context of the NPC transport ) and the analysis of single molecule tracking experiments [57] , [68]\u2013[71] . Finally , our theory can be generalized to describe mechanisms of selectivity in arbitrary signal transduction schemes [67] , [72]\u2013[74] .\nThe analytical calculations were perfromed by pencil and paper with the help of Mathematica 5 . 2 package .

Similarly, living cells rely on efficient and selective transport of molecules in and out of the cell, and between different cellular compartments. This process is crucial for the cell's survival and function. Researchers have long been fascinated by the mechanisms that govern this selective transport, and a recent study has shed new light on this complex process.\n\n**The Problem: Selective Transport in a Crowded Environment**\n\nIn the cell, transport channels play a vital role in regulating the movement of molecules. However, these channels often face a daunting task: selecting specific molecules from a vast background of non-specific molecules that can interact with the channel. This is akin to finding a specific person in a crowded city. The question is, how do these channels maintain selective transport in such conditions?\n\n**A New Mechanism: Competition for Space**\n\nResearchers have proposed a novel kinetic mechanism that explains how selective transport can occur in the presence of non-specific competition. The mechanism relies on two essential ingredients: transient trapping of molecules inside the channel and competition for limited space inside the channel. In essence, strongly trapped molecules (those that spend more time in the channel) can exclude weakly trapped molecules (those that spend less time in the channel) from transport.\n\n**The Model: A Simple yet Powerful Explanation**\n\nThe researchers developed a mathematical model that simulates the transport of molecules through a narrow channel. The model shows that in the presence of strongly trapped molecules, the transport of weakly trapped molecules is strongly inhibited. This inhibition is not due to prevention of entrance into the channel but rather due to the diminished probability of translocating through the channel.\n\n**Experimental Validation: Artificial Nano-Channels**\n\nThe researchers compared their theoretical predictions with experimental data from artificial nano-channels that mimic the function of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The results showed that the transport of non-specific molecules was inhibited by the presence of specific molecules, in agreement with the theoretical predictions.\n\n**Implications: A New Understanding of Cellular Transport**\n\nThis study provides a new understanding of how cellular transport channels can maintain selective transport in the presence of non-specific competition. The mechanism proposed is a purely kinetic, non-equilibrium process that does not require input of metabolic energy. This means that the effect is expected to hold for various molecular mechanisms of transport through channels, channel widths, and particle sizes.\n\n**Future Directions: Refining the Theory and Designing Selective Artificial Nano-Channels**\n\nThe study highlights the need to consider non-specific competition when studying transport selectivity of both biological and artificial nano-channels. Future research will focus on refining the theory and elucidating additional selectivity mechanisms, allowing for the design of more selective artificial nano-channels. The study also opens up new avenues for research in signal transduction schemes and single molecule tracking experiments.\n\nIn summary, this study has uncovered a new mechanism for selective transport in cellular channels, providing a deeper understanding of how cells regulate the movement of molecules. The findings have significant implications for the design of artificial nano-channels and the development of new technologies for molecular sorting and separation.", "topic": "Cellular transport", "cat": []}
{"input": "Characteristics of mosquito larval habitats are important in determining whether they can survive and successfully complete their developmental stages . Therefore , data on the ecological factors affecting mosquito density and abundance especially the physicochemical properties of water of their breeding sites , can possibly be helpful in implementing larval management programs . Mosquito larvae were collected using a standard 350 ml dipper from fixed habitats including: artificial pool , river edge , creek and etc , in 30 villages of 16 counties from May-December 2014 . Water samples were collected during larval collection and temperature ( \u00b0C ) , acidity ( pH ) , turbidity ( NTU ) , electrical conductivity ( \u03bcS/cm ) , alkalinity ( mg/l CaCO3 ) , total hardness ( mg/l ) , nitrate ( mg/l ) , chloride ( mg/l ) , phosphate ( mg/l ) and sulphate ( mg/l ) were measured using standard methods . Spearman correlation coefficient , Kruskal-Wallis test of nonparametric analysis , Chi-square ( \u03c72 ) analysis , regression analysis and C8 interspecific correlation coefficient were used for data analysis . A total of 7 , 566 mosquito larvae belonging to 15 species representing three genera were collected from fixed larval breeding places . Culex pipiens was the dominant species except in four villages where An . maculipennis s . l . and Cx . torrentium were predominant . There was a significant positive correlation between the density of Cx . pipiens and electrical conductivity , alkalinity , total hardness and chloride , whereas no significant negative correlation was observed between physicochemical factors and larval density . The highest interspecific association of up to 0 . 596 was observed between An . maculipennis s . l/An . pseudopictus followed by up to 0 . 435 between An . maculipennis s . l/An . hyrcanus and An . hyrcanus/An . pseudopictus . The correlations observed between physicochemical factors and larval density , can possibly confirm the effect of these parameters on the breeding activities of mosquitoes , and may be indicative of the presence of certain mosquito fauna in a given region .\nWater characteristics of breeding places are important for oviposition and development of mosquitoes [1] . Different characteristics of the oviposition sites such as: vegetation , temperature , turbidity , pH , concentration of ammonia , nitrite and nitrate , sulphate , phosphate , chloride , calcium , and water hardness affect mosquito larval density [2\u20134] . Changing these factors in larval habitats may create conditions favorable or unfavorable for mosquito biology [5] . Temperature lower than 14\u201316\u00b0C and higher than 30\u00b0C reduces the rate of larval development of many species [2 , 6] . Larvae of most mosquito species are found in nature in pH 3 . 3\u201310 . 5 [2] . Studies in several micro and macrohabitats have revealed that distribution of Cx . pipiens , Cs . longiareolata , Cx . antennatus , Oc . caspius , Cx . vagans , Cx . decens , Cx . perexiguus , Cx . univittatus , An . multicolor are directly correlated with temperature , ammonia , nitrate , pH , dissolved oxygen and salinity [7 , 8]; An . culicifacies with temperature and dissolved oxygen [1 , 9]; Ae . albopictus with conductivity , total dissolved solids , nitrate , phosphate , sulphate , turbidity and salinity [10 , 11]; and An . varuna with calcium [1] . While larval densities of Cx . pipiens , Cx . perexiguus and Ae . albopictus are not directly affected by total nitrogen content , salinity and turbidity [8 , 10 , 11] . Dissolved nitrogen content can be a limiting factor on larval growth of the genus Aedes ( formerly Ochlerotatus ) by indirect effects on the trophic structure of tree-hole environments [12] . Although abundance of larvae can be associated with the soluble nitrate and phosphate levels in an area [13] , it can equally be independent of those in another area because the nitrogen or phosphorus in water bodies can result in eutrophication and oxygen depletion , harmful algal blooms , toxic effects on fish and some aquatic organisms and overall reductions in aquatic biodiversity [4 , 14] . Therefore other factors can be effective in predicting larval density in different areas [15] . For example , the vegetation of mosquito larval habitats is considered as an important factor in the process of egg-laying and density of mosquito larvae [16] . Tall emergent aquatic plants can cover the surface and decrease mosquito larval density by acting as a barrier for egg-laying female . They may cause microbial growth and produce a high variety of predators [17] . Not much data currently exists regarding the physiochemical characteristics of mosquito larval habitats in Iran . Most of the available data is on anopheline mosquito larval habitats . The distribution of An . sacharovi is significantly associated with calcium bicarbonate , sodium sulphate and salinity in larval habitats in Ardebil Province , northwestern Iran[18] . Larval density of An . culicifacies s . l . , An . dthali , An . stephensi , An . superpictus , An . fluviatilis s . l . , An . turkhudi , An . moghulensis , and An . apoci is associated with temperature , EC , alkalinity , chloride and sulphate , total hardness , and dry residues in Bashagard and Rudan district , southern Iran [15 , 19] . A significant difference was observed between the density of An . culicifacies and phosphate , calcium and EC; An . turkhudi and pH , total hardness and nitrate; An . superpictus and total hardness and nitrate; An . stephensi and nitrate , An . multicolor and pH and sulphate in Iranshahr , southwestern Iran [20] . Temperature , pH , turbidity , EC , TDS , alkalinity , total hardness , calcium , chloride , fluoride , nitrite , nitrate , phosphate , sulphate were not significantly correlated with An . claviger , An . marteri , An . superpictus , An . turkhudi , Cx . arbieeni , Cx . hortensis , Cx . mimeticus , Cx . modestus , Cx . pipiens , Cx . territans , Cx . theileri , Cs . longiareolata , Cs . subochrea , Oc . caspius s . l . in Qom Province , central Iran [21] To date , there is no information on physicochemical characteristics of mosquito larval habitats and coefficient of interspecific association ( C8 ) in Mazandaran Province and this is the first such study in the province . Differences in environmental and geographical characteristics of the North of Iran in comparison with other provinces of the country have caused a fertile environment for the development of mosquitoes . The area had a history of diseases transmitted by vectors , the most important of which has been Malaria . Mazandaran has a unique environment fit for migratory birds and thousands of different wild bird species that spend winter in numerous fresh water lakes and wetlands across the province . West Nile virus is circulating in the province between the migratory birds and humans mostly by Culex mosquitoes [22 , 23] . Also , the environment may allow the invasion and establishment of Aedes vectors of dengue and Zika based on the risk assessment of the latter , a huge national research activity is underway to verify the risk . Information on the ecological factors affecting mosquito larval biology such as the physicochemical properties of the water of the breeding places and interspecific associations are important in survival , spatio-temporal distribution [24] , biodiversity , affinity and association indices of disease vectors [25\u201327] . The information may serve as the basis for designing and implementation of adequate vector control programs [28] . Despite the voluminous literature on the distribution of mosquito larvae and physicochemical factors , the data set seems to be inconclusive in leading to a prediction of the presence of larvae in different habitats . Therefore more studies and systematic reviews with proper generalization are required . The present study was conducted to document the relationship between physicochemical characteristics of mosquito larval habitats and the presence or absence of a given species , density or diversity and interspecific associations of larvae in different habitats in Mazandaran Province .\nThis research has been approved by the Ethic committee of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences under the code 1017 . The study was carried out from May to December 2014 in Mazandaran Province located within the latitude of 35\u00b0 47\u2032- 36\u00b0 35\u2032 N and longitude of 50\u00b0 34\u2032\u201354\u00b0 10\u2032 E ( Fig 1 ) . The province has an area of 23756 . 4 km2 and a population of 3 , 073 , 943 ( 2011 census ) [29] . It is located between Golestan Province in the East , Gilan Province in the West , Caspian Sea in the North and Tehran and Semnan Provinces in the South . The inhabitants are mainly involved in agriculture , animal husbandry , production of farmed fish and tourism industry . The climate varies from mild and humid in the Caspian Sea shore to moderate and cold in mountainous regions . The minimum and maximum mean annual temperatures and rainfall ranges between 1 . 2\u201329 . 2\u00b0C and 0\u2013755 . 6 mm , respectively . Mosquito larvae were collected by standard 350 ml dipper from fixed oviposition sites ( breeding places with permanent water during the sampling period ) such as artificial pools , river edge , creek , marsh , large metal bucket , abandoned wells , water canals , pit with plastic floor ( Fig 2 ) , in 30 villages of 16 counties across the province ( Fig 1 ) . In each village , one fixed station was selected and visited for larval collection once a month . It is important to mention that one hundred staff members of the Mazandaran health centers were recruited and trained during two theoretical and practical workshops before undertaking sample collection . We met with county and village councils to seek cooperation of the villagers for assistance with sampling team . Collected larvae were conserved in lactophenol and were transferred to the Medical Entomology Laboratory at Faculty of Health , Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences . In the laboratory , microscope slides were prepared from each of the specimens using Berlese\u2019s medium and larvae were identified by morphological characteristics according to appropriate keys [30 , 31] . Water samples were collected from the same 30 fixed larval habitats in which dip samples had been collected in designated villages and were kept in one liter appropriately labeled polyethylene bottles . The bottles were placed inside an ice box and were sent for analysis to the Faculty of Health . Temperature ( \u00b0C ) , acidity ( pH ) , turbidity ( NTU ) , electrical conductivity ( EC ) ( Micro-Simens/cm ) ( \u03bcS/cm ) , alkalinity ( mg/l CaCO3 ) , total hardness ( mg/l ) , nitrate ( mg/l ) , chloride ( mg/l ) , phosphate ( mg/l ) and sulphate ( mg/l ) of the water were measured . Water temperature and pH were measured on site using a thermometer and pH probe ( Eutech-Cyberscan PH5500 ) , turbidity using a turbidimeter device ( 2100P Portable Turbidimeter at Hach ) , EC using a conductometer device ( EC LYTIC-AQUA ( CON200 ) before dipping . Alkalinity , total hardness and chloride were determined using direct titration techniques and nitrate , sulphate and phosphate were measured using a spectrophotometer device ( Perkinelmer UV/Visible Lambda EZ201 and HACH ) . All analyses were conducted according to the standard methods used in Rice et al . [32] . The species data from each site was summed up and collectively reported in a graph . The means and standard deviations of physicochemical parameters of each breeding site was calculated using SPSS software version 19 . The presumption for normality was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test . The physicochemical parameters among sites were compared by Kruskal-Wallis test of nonparametric analysis . Chi-square ( \u03c72 ) analysis was performed to determine whether there was any significant difference in distribution of the species in different counties . The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to examine the relation of the mosquito larval densities to the physicochemical factors adjusted by types of habitats . Regression analysis between larval densities and physicochemical factor were also performed to clarify the relationship and r-squared values were calculated . Hurlbert\u2019s coefficient of interspecific association ( C8 ) was used to measure the associations between co-occurring species using presence-absence data . Values of C8 range from -1 to +1 for negative and positive associations , respectively . Positive associations between species can probably show a common habitat preference or interspecific attraction , whereas negative associations may reveal different habitat preferences or interspecific repulsion . The formula used for calculating C8 is as follows: C8=ad\u2212bc|ad\u2212bc||Obsx2\u2212Minx2Maxx2\u2212Minx2| where a , b , c , and d are the values in four cells of a 2 \u00d7 2 contingency table; Obs \u03c72 is referred to the value of \u03c72 associated with the observed values of a , b , c and d; Max \u03c72 is referred to the value of \u03c72 when a is as large ( if ad \u2265bc ) or as small ( if ad < bc ) as the marginal totals of the 2 \u00d7 2 table permit; Min \u03c72 is referred to the value of \u03c72 when the observed a differs from its expected value ( \u00e2 ) by less than 1 . 00 [33] .\nA total of 7 , 566 mosquito larvae from three genera and 15 species were collected from eleven different types of fixed oviposition sites . Using random effect model , it is observed that habitats type affect the abundance of species ( P < 0 . 05 ) . Culex pipiens ( 56 . 22% ) , Cx . tritaeniorhynchus ( 10 . 05% ) and An . maculipennis s . l . ( 10 . 50% ) , were the most abundant species observed in artificial pool . whereas , An . marteri ( 0 . 06% ) , Cx . hortensis ( 0 . 15% ) and Cs . morsitans ( 0 . 08% ) were relatively uncommon in habitats such as concrete canal , artificial pool and tire; respectively ( Fig 3 ) . Using the coefficient of interspecific association ( C8 ) , significant positive associations was determined between An . maculipennis s . l/An . hyrcanus and An . hyrcanus/An . pseudopictus of up to 0 . 435 . This coefficient was up to 0 . 596 between An . maculipennis s . l/An . pseudopictus ( Table 1 ) . There are significant differences in the distribution of the species in spatial scale ( P < 0 . 05 ) . Culex pipiens had the largest distribution and was the dominant species in all villages except Tileno , Zavat , Asad Abad and Shah Mansur Mahale . The highest and the lowest number and percentage of Cx . pipiens were recorded in the villages of Firozabad ( 558 , 86 . 11% ) and Tileno ( 3 , 3 . 26% ) , respectively . Culex tritaeniorhynchus was dispersed in all villages except Abbasa and Soleymanabad and showed the highest abundance in the village of Al Tappeh ( 95 , 24 . 05% ) . Anopheles maculipennis s . l . were the dominant anopheline in the villages of Tileno , Zavat and Shah Mansur Mahale and showed the highest dispersion rate compared to the rest of the Anopheles . Culiseta morsitans and An . marteri showed the lowest distribution in the villages of Bishekola ( 0 . 76% ) and Chalmardi ( 0 . 40% ) . Data regarding distribution of other species in spatial scale are shown in Fig 4 . Means and standard deviations of the physicochemical factors from larval habitats in different villages were calculated for each species . Culiseta morsitans was found in breeding sites with higher pH up to 7 . 44 . It prefers lower temperature , alkalinity , nitrate , chloride and phosphate . Anopheles marteri prefers higher turbidity , alkalinity , total hardness , phosphate and sulphate , while An . claviger , Cx . mimeticus and Cx . perexiguus breed in habitats with higher temperature , EC and chloride , respectively . Culex mimeticus , Cx . hortensis , Cx . torrentium and An . claviger were collected in habitats with the lowest ranges of pH ( 6 . 88\u00b10 . 40 ) , turbidity ( 12 . 50\u00b10 . 70 ) , EC ( 69 . 42\u00b11051 . 15 ) , total hardness ( 192 ) and sulphate ( 14 . 18 ) , respectively ( Table 2 ) . Ranges of the physicochemical parameters of larval habitats of different species are presented in Table 2 . Positive correlation exists between the larval abundance of Cx . pipiens and the physicochemical characteristics including EC , alkalinity , total hardness and chloride with Spearman rank correlations of 0 . 575 ( P<0 . 001 ) , 0 . 617 ( P<0 . 001 ) , 0 . 495 ( P<0 . 005 ) and 0 . 539 ( P<0 . 002 ) , respectively . However , there was no significant negative correlation between physicochemical characteristics and larval abundance ( Table 3 ) . The regression relationship ( R2 ) between Cx . pipiens and EC , alkalinity , total hardness and chloride were 0 . 11 , 0 . 20 , 0 . 01 and 0 . 06 , respectively which is shown by Scatter plot ( Fig 5 ) .\nIn conclusion , based on the findings of the present study , physicochemical factors of breeding sites including EC , alkalinity , total hardness and chloride may determine the distribution and abundance of Cx . pipiens in the area . Although seems important and expected to be observed , a significant positive correlation has not been detected for the rest of the species present in the study area . High interspecific association between pair of species An . maculipennis s . l/An . pseudopictus show that these species have common needs and adaptability for sympatry . These findings could be useful in comprehending the ecology of mosquito larvae that may be beneficial in designing and implementing larval control programs . This is the first study looking at the physicochemical parameters associated with larval abundance and diversity in Mazandaran Province . Further studies are needed to enable the use of this information in vector control programs with confidence . It should be noted that there is a limitation to this study and that is we measured the physicochemical parameters only once in the whole of the study areas and sampling locations whereas the density of mosquito larvae measured every month . The possibility of relation of larval habitats physicochemical parameters and larval density fluctuation might have well been established should the trend of changes of the physicochemical parameters be determined , this has further research implications .", "output": "**Understanding Mosquito Breeding Habits to Combat Disease**\n\nMosquitoes are a major public health concern, as they can transmit diseases like malaria, dengue, and Zika. To effectively control mosquito populations, it's essential to understand their breeding habits and the environmental factors that influence their development. A recent study in Mazandaran Province, Iran, investigated the relationship between the physical and chemical characteristics of mosquito breeding sites and the presence of different mosquito species.\n\n**Why is this research important?**\n\nMosquitoes need specific conditions to breed and develop, and understanding these conditions can help us design effective control programs. By identifying the physical and chemical characteristics of breeding sites that favor certain mosquito species, we can target these areas for control measures, reducing the risk of disease transmission.\n\n**What did the researchers do?**\n\nThe researchers collected mosquito larvae from 30 villages in Mazandaran Province, representing 15 different species. They also measured various physical and chemical parameters of the breeding sites, such as temperature, pH, turbidity, and electrical conductivity. The researchers used statistical analysis to identify correlations between these parameters and the presence of different mosquito species.\n\n**What did they find?**\n\nThe study found that certain mosquito species, such as Culex pipiens, were more abundant in breeding sites with specific physical and chemical characteristics, such as higher electrical conductivity, alkalinity, and total hardness. The researchers also found significant positive associations between certain species, indicating that they may have common habitat preferences or interspecific attractions.\n\n**What are the implications of this research?**\n\nThe findings of this study can inform the design of effective mosquito control programs in Mazandaran Province and other regions with similar environmental conditions. By targeting breeding sites with specific physical and chemical characteristics, control measures can be more effective in reducing mosquito populations and the risk of disease transmission. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of considering the ecological factors that influence mosquito breeding habits in the development of control programs.\n\n**Limitations and future research directions**\n\nThe study had some limitations, including the measurement of physical and chemical parameters only once during the study period. Future research should aim to investigate the temporal changes in these parameters and their relationship with mosquito larval density. Further studies are also needed to validate the findings of this research and to develop effective control programs that can be implemented in different regions.", "topic": "Mosquito control", "cat": []}
{"input": "Cryptosporidium is a major pathogen associated with diarrheal disease in young children . We studied Cryptosporidium diarrhea in children enrolled in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study ( GEMS ) in rural Gambia . We recruited children <5 years of age with moderate-to-severe diarrhea ( MSD ) for 3 years ( 2008\u20132010 ) , and children with either MSD or less severe diarrhea ( LSD ) for one year ( November 2011-November 2012 ) at sentinel health centers . One or more randomly selected controls were matched to each case . Stool samples were tested to identify Cryptosporidium by immunoassay . A subset of randomly selected case-controls pairs were tested for Cryptosporidium species . We investigated the epidemiology of , and evaluated possible risk factors for , Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea . We enrolled 1938 cases ( 1381 MSD , 557 LSD ) and 2969 matched controls; 231/1929 ( 12 . 0% ) of diarrhea cases and 141/2962 ( 4 . 8% ) of controls were positive for Cryptosporidium . Most Cryptosporidium diarrhea cases ( 85 . 7% , 198/231 ) were aged 6\u201323 months , and most ( 81 . 4% , 188/231 ) occurred during the rainy season . Cryptosporidium hominis ( C . hominis ) was the predominant ( 82 . 6% ) species . We found associations between increased risk of Cryptosporidium-positive MSD or LSD , or both , with consumption of stored drinking water and certain animals living in the compound\u2014cow , cat ( MSD only ) and rodents ( LSD only ) . Larger households , fowl living in the compound , and the presence of Giardia infection were associated with decreased risk of Cryptosporidium MSD and LSD . Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea is prevalent in this setting , especially at 6\u201323 months of age . The preponderance of Cryptosporidium infection in the rainy season and increased risk of Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea with consumption of stored drinking water suggest water-borne transmission . Further investigation is needed to clarify the role of animals and contamination of stored drinking water in Cryptosporidium transmission .\nDiarrhea is the second leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children less than 5 years old , causing approximately 600 , 000 annual deaths , mostly in developing countries [1] . Cryptosporidium , a protozoan parasite , is transmitted like other diarrheal pathogens by the fecal-oral route and is more prevalent in patients with HIV/AIDS , in whom it causes severe and prolonged gastrointestinal illness [2\u20135] . However , the recent Global Enteric Multicenter Study ( GEMS ) found that Cryptosporidium was the third most common pathogen contributing to moderate-to-severe diarrhea ( MSD ) in children aged less than 5 years , irrespective of HIV prevalence [6 , 7] . A multisite birth cohort community-based study ( MAL-ED ) also detected a high burden of Cryptosporidium associated mild and severe infectious diarrhea among children aged 0\u201324 months [8 , 9] . In addition to the substantial burden of gastroenteritis , Cryptosporidium with or without concomitant diarrhea has been associated with growth faltering and weight loss [10\u201313] , and with lowered physical fitness , decreased cognitive function [14] and increased mortality [2 , 6 , 7] . Cryptosporidium is associated with an estimated 48 , 000 global deaths per year in children aged less than five years [12] . In sub-Saharan Africa , the prevalence of , and risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection have been studied mostly through cross-sectional surveys over limited time periods with relatively few Cryptosporidium-positive cases [15\u201318] . The MAL-ED study documented risk factors of Cryptosporidium only in diarrhea cases of any severity and the effect of co-infection with other enteric pathogens were not assessed [19] . In contrast with the global burden and severity of diarrheal disease with Cryptosporidium , information on transmission in developing countries is limited [20 , 21] . GEMS was a comprehensive study conducted for several years and using standardised diagnostic methods to determine the disease burden , epidemiology and risk factors for a wide variety of pathogens that may cause diarrhea ( 23\u201326 ) . The GEMS study detected that Cryptosporidium was among the leading etiologies of MSD in eastern Gambia , accounting for 12% and 8% of MSD in 0\u201311 months and 12\u201323 months , respectively [6] . In this paper we report secondary analyses of GEMS data in The Gambia in order to characterize the epidemiology of Cryptosporidium infection in diarrhea cases and their controls and to identify risk factors for Cryptosporidium-associated diarrhea .\nThe study was approved by The Gambia Government/MRC joint Ethics Committee ( SCC # 1054 ) and IRB of University of Maryland , Baltimore ( HM-HP-00040030 ) . Written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians of study participants . Analysis was done using SAS version 9 . 4 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC , USA ) , Stata SE 12 . 0 ( StataCorp . 2011 , College Station , Texas , USA ) , R 3 . 5 . 1 [28] and Microsoft Excel . Results with p < 0 . 05 were generally considered statistically significant; we used p < 0 . 10 in evaluating differences between associations with Cryptosporidium-positive MSD and LSD in multivariable modeling ( i . e . , in evaluating interaction terms ) . Proportions were measured for categorical data . Differences in proportions were assessed by chi-square test . Continuous data were described by means ( SD ) or medians ( range ) . Data on building materials and household possessions ( e . g . , electricity , television , radio , phone , bicycle , car , boat , refrigerator and finished floor and number of sleeping rooms in the dwellings ) were used to construct a wealth index [24 , 29] as a measure of socio-economic status . Length or height was determined as the median of three repeated measurements . A height-for-age Z-score ( HAZ ) was calculated according to WHO guidelines ( 31 ) , with HAZ < -2 used to define low height-for-age or stunting . Extreme HAZ values of ( <-6 or >+6 ) were excluded from analysis . The attributable fraction in the exposed ( AFE ) was calculated for the age range ( 0\u201323 months ) for which Cryptosporidium was a significant pathogen for the entire GEMS study . From the population attributable fractions and total estimated cases with Cryptosporidium identified at the Gambia site [6 , 30] , the number of cases attributable to Cryptosporidium was estimated for the age groups 0\u201311 months and 12\u201323 months , separately for MSD and LSD . AFE is the ratio of the number of cases attributable to Cryptosporidium to the total cases positive for Cryptosporidium . Associations of Cryptosporidium with diarrhea overall and within strata of age , sex , season , and type of diarrhea ( MSD or LSD ) were evaluated using conditional logistic regression . Analysis of associations with Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea was restricted to Cryptosporidium-positive cases and their matched controls . First we fit univariate conditional logistic regression models for any Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea with single factors as covariates . Starting with variables associated with Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea with a p \u2264 0 . 2 threshold , we fit multivariable conditional logistic regression models using a backward elimination stepwise process to identify a set of factors , each associated with p < 0 . 05 . We then developed separate models for MSD and LSD by including the interaction of each factor with an indicator variable for MSD or LSD . We could not include a \u201cmain effect\u201d for MSD/LSD because cases and controls were matched on MSD/LSD . We evaluated associations with socio-demographic variables , breastfeeding status , water source and hygiene variables , animals living in the compound , HAZ score , and presence of other potential pathogens ( rotavirus , Shigella , norovirus , adenovirus 40/41 , ETEC-ST , Giardia , Entamoeba histolytica , and Ascaris lumbricoides ) .\nWe enrolled 1938 cases ( 1381 MSD and 557 LSD ) and 2969 matched controls ( Fig 1 ) . Of the study participants tested for Cryptosporidium , 231 of 1929 cases ( 12 . 0% ) and 141 of 2962 controls ( 4 . 8% ) were positive ( p = <0 . 001 ) ; data for Cryptosporidium were missing for 9 cases and 7 controls . Table 1 shows the prevalence of Cryptosporidium in cases and controls within categories of age , sex , season , and type of diarrhea ( MSD or LSD ) . Prevalence was higher in cases than in controls for both MSD ( 12 . 2% vs . 4 . 8% , p<0 . 001 ) and LSD ( 11 . 5% vs . 4 . 6% , p<0 . 001 ) . Cryptosporidium prevalence was similar in children with MSD ( 167/1381 , 12 . 1% ) and LSD ( 64/557 , 11 . 5% ) ( p = 0 . 71 by z-test for proportions ) . AFE was estimated as 76% and 70% for MSD at ages 0\u201311 months and 12\u201323 months , respectively . The corresponding estimates for LSD were 65% and 64% . For the age range 0\u201323 months , AFE was 73% for MSD and 65% for LSD . Cryptosporidium prevalence was higher in cases than in controls within all age groups and for both males and females ( Table 1 ) . Prevalence in cases was much higher in children aged 6\u201323 months than in younger infants or children aged 24\u201359 months , and similar between males and females . Odds ratios for Cryptosporidium prevalence in cases versus controls were also highest at ages 6\u201323 months . Prevalence in cases was similar for males and females . Cryptosporidium prevalence was higher in cases than in controls in both the dry and wet seasons ( Table 1 ) . Furthermore , relative to dry season , Cryptosporidium is much more prevalent in both cases and controls during the wet and rainy season ( May-October ) . The overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium in both cases and controls usually started to rise in May , with a peak between July and October ( Fig 2 ) . Cryptosporidium diarrhea cases peaked in September ( 28 . 3% of all cases ) and October ( 28 . 2% of cases ) ; prevalence was low between January and April ( range , 0 . 64%-2 . 8% ) . Cryptosporidium results from the TaqMan assay were available for 1506 stool samples ( 759 cases and 747 controls ) ; 280 ( 18 . 6% ) of these were positive for Cryptosporidium by TaqMan PCR , 121 ( 8 . 0% ) were positive by EIA , and 104 ( 6 . 9% ) were positive by both assays . The TaqMan assay was used to identify samples positive for C . hominius or C . parvum . Of the 280 positives by Taqman , 119 ( 42 . 5% ) were positive for C . hominis , and 20 ( 7 . 1% ) were positive for C . parvum and 5 ( 1 . 8% ) were positive for both . Among 144 samples with both species identified , only C . hominis was in 119 ( 82 . 6% ) , only C . parvum in 20 ( 13 . 9% ) , and both C . hominis and C . parvum was in 5 ( 3 . 5% ) . C . hominis was more frequently positive in cases than in controls ( 78/753 , 10 . 4% vs . 46/741 , 6 . 2%; p = 0 . 004 ) . The frequencies of C . parvum were similar in cases and controls ( 12/746 , 1 . 6% vs . 13/739 , 1 . 8%; p = 0 . 82 ) . Analysis of risk factors included 231 Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea cases and 349 matched controls; 36 ( 10 . 3% ) of the controls were positive for Cryptosporidium infection ( Table 2 ) . One hundred sixty-seven ( 72 . 3% ) of the cases had MSD and 64 ( 27 . 7% ) had LSD . Since controls were matched to cases by age and sex , no analysis of these variables was done . Results of univariable conditional regression analyses are summarized in Table 2 for socioeconomic characteristics , animals living in the compound , water source and hygiene , breast feeding status , nutritional status , and the presence of other putative pathogens . In Table 2 , the median numbers of household members for Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea cases and their matched controls were 25 ( range , 3\u2013112 ) and 34 ( range , 3\u2013118 ) , respectively . The mean number of household members and the proportion households with more than 20 members were significantly higher in controls than in cases . Children with Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea were significantly more likely than their matched controls to live in a compound with a cat , cow or rodents . Fowl ( chicken , duck or other birds ) living in the compound was more common in controls than cases . Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea was significantly associated with drinking stored water at home in the last two weeks and drinking water usually filtered through a cloth . The proportions of cases and controls currently being breast fed , as well as the proportions of cases and controls with stunting , were similar and not significantly different . The proportion of Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea cases co-infected with Giardia , the most common protozoal co-infection , was significantly lower than the proportion in their matched controls . No other co-infection evaluated was significantly associated with Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea . Table 3 summarizes the results of multivariable conditional logistic regression modeling for associations with Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea . Inclusion of interactions with an MSD/LSD indicator variable allowed development of separate models for Cryptosporidium-positive MSD and Cryptosporidium-positive LSD . All factors in the table were significantly associated ( 95% confidence interval for odds ratio did not include 1 ) for either MSD , LSD , or both . There was an increased risk of Cryptosporidium-positive MSD and/or LSD for certain animals ( cow , cat , rodents ) in the household , as well as the child drinking stored drinking water at home in the last two weeks . There were significant differences ( p < 0 . 05 for interaction term ) between MSD and LSD for odds ratios for a cow or cat living in the compound and a suggestion of a difference ( p = 0 . 069 ) for rodents in the compound . There was no evidence of a difference between MSD and LSD in the association with number of people living in the household ( in units of 5 individuals ) , child consuming stored drinking water at home in the last two weeks , fowl living in the compound or mixed infection with Giardia .\nOur findings in this comprehensive population-based epidemiological study of endemic Cryptosporidium infection in young Gambian children show a striking association of Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea with age , with nearly all cases ( 86% ) occurring in children 6\u201323 months of age . A similar trend with a lower overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea , was observed in a study conducted in urban Gambia during 1991\u20131992 [18] . Other studies in sub-Saharan Africa have shown roughly similar prevalence but may lack the representativeness of long-term population-based studies with improved diagnostic techniques [21] . The low prevalence in infants 0\u20135 months of age may be explained by exclusive breast feeding [31] or transfer of immunity from mother to child . The high prevalence at 6\u201323 months of age may be due to exposure to contaminated food and/or water in the weaning period . Stenberg et al . demonstrated in a sero-prevalence study in Guatemala that the prevalence of antibody to Cryptosporidium parvum increased at older ages compared to those aged 6\u201312 months [32] . Furthermore , a study in healthy adult volunteers showed that higher anti-Cryptosporidium IgG antibody levels were associated with a reduced chance of infection and illness when challenged with low Cryptosporidium oocyst doses [33] . Thus , the low prevalence of Cryptosporidium in children 24\u201359 months of age may relate to the development of immunity following earlier infection . A decreased risk of infection in older children due to the development of partial immunity from earlier exposure would suggest that a vaccine may protect against Cryptosporidium infection . The population HIV prevalence is low in our study area ( <2% ) [22] . Our findings show that Cryptosporidium is an important infection in young children even in a population with low HIV prevalence . C . hominis is the predominant among identified species of C . hominis and C . Parvum ( 82 . 6% vs . 13 . 9% ) in the Gambia . This finding is consistent with results from other studies in Kenya , Malawi , Uganda , Bangladesh and India [5 , 11 , 16 , 34 , 35] . It suggests that the primary mode of transmission in The Gambia is anthroponotic transmission , although there may also be zoonotic transmission . Either may occur through contact with contaminated drinking water [19] . Accordingly , we found consumption of stored drinking water to be associated with increased risk of Cryptosporidium diarrhea . In our study , 81% of Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea cases and 79% of Cryptosporidium-positive controls occurred during the rainy season . Earlier studies in The Gambia [18] , Madagascar [36] , Guinea-Bissau [37] , Brazil [38 , 39] and India [40] found associations between Cryptosporidium diarrhea and rainy season . The association of rainfall and Cryptosporidium infection could be due to domestic use of surface water , contamination of unprotected wells , and poor hygiene practices . In the rainy season , surface water may be more often contaminated with human and animal feces , so that children playing in the contaminated surface or stagnant water could facilitate the transmission of Cryptosporidium . However , Cryptosporidium infection has also been observed predominantly in the dry season in Kenya and Guatemala , when drinking water is limited [34 , 41] . In our study area , drinking water is usually stored in wide-mouth containers . Household members and children use their hands to dip a cup into the water storage container to obtain drinking water , which may further contaminate the water . The chance of contamination may be increased with prolonged storage and handling if the storage container is not frequently cleaned . Further exploration of storage practices , sanitation and hygiene measures for collection of water and removing water from the container , as well as further laboratory analysis of potable water from the source to storage and point of consumption may all help to establish the source of infection . Contrary to the findings of an association of household overcrowding with increased risk of cryptosporidiosis , our study found the opposite . The reasons for this negative association are not clear . In an urban area , close proximity of houses , overcrowding , close personal contract and lack of sanitary facilities may contribute to the spread of C . hominis infection [42] . Perhaps in a rural setting , the greater physical space available per person leads to less close contact between children in the household . We found that the presence in the compound of domestic animals ( cattle and cats ) and the presence of rodents in the compound were potential risk factors for Cryptosporidium diarrhea . Association of Cryptosporidium diarrhea with the presence of animals was also found in Guinea Bissau and Guatemala [41 , 43] . We believe that our study is the first to suggest an association between rodents living in a household and the presence of Cryptosporidium diarrhea . Human carriage of Cryptosporidium muris , a predominantly rodent pathogen , and rodents have been identified as reservoirs of C . parvum and C . hominis [44 , 45] . The presence of Giardia was inversely associated with Cryptosporidium diarrhea . Similarly , a longitudinal analysis in another study showed no evidence of an association between Giardia infection and an increased risk of diarrhea [46] . In a systematic review , giardiasis was associated with decreased risk of acute diarrhea in children in developing countries [47]; however , the same review found that Giardia infection was positively associated with persistent diarrhea and suggested that initial Giardia infections early in infancy may be positively associated with diarrhea . Giardia may secrete mucins and glycoproteins in the intestinal mucosal layer , which may protect against attachment of other pathogens including Cryptosporidium , and such a mechanism may protect against Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea [48] . A limitation of the study is that only about 68% of Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea cases can be attributed to Cryptosporidium . Thus , some of the risk factor associations that we found could be at least partially due to factors other than the presence of Cryptosporidium . However , it is clear both from the present study and other studies that infants and young children in developing countries with Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea are at risk of negative health consequences and that reducing the level of Cryptosporidium infection is an important public health concern in these countries .\nOur study establishes that Cryptosporidium is an important cause of childhood diarrhea in The Gambia . Data from the ongoing rotavirus vaccine impact study will help us understand the burden of Cryptosporidium infection in Africa after introduction of rotavirus vaccine in routine immunization programs . The drinking stored water and animals living in the household are associated with Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea . The predominance of C . hominis suggests anthroponotic transmission of Cryptosporidium infection . Associations of Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea with drinking of stored water and animals living in the household suggest there may also be zoonotic transmission . Thus , general improved hygienic practices to store drinking water may reduce transmission of Cryptosporidium . The role of animals in the transmission of Cryptosporidium , the methods of drinking water storage , and sanitation and hygiene measures used for taking water from the water storage containers merit further study .", "output": "**Cryptosporidium: A Major Cause of Diarrhea in Young Children in The Gambia**\n\nDiarrhea is a leading cause of illness and death in children under the age of five, particularly in developing countries. A recent study in The Gambia, a country in West Africa, has shed light on the role of Cryptosporidium, a parasite that causes diarrhea, in this age group.\n\n**What is Cryptosporidium?**\n\nCryptosporidium is a parasite that is transmitted through contaminated food and water, and can cause severe diarrhea in young children. It is a major public health concern in developing countries, where access to clean water and sanitation is limited.\n\n**The Study**\n\nThe study, which was part of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), recruited children under the age of five with diarrhea from rural areas of The Gambia. The researchers collected stool samples from the children and tested them for Cryptosporidium. They also collected information on the children's living conditions, including access to clean water and sanitation, and the presence of animals in the household.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\nThe study found that Cryptosporidium was a major cause of diarrhea in young children in The Gambia, particularly in children aged 6-23 months. The parasite was found in 12% of children with diarrhea, and was more common in children who drank stored water and had animals living in their household. The study also found that the presence of Giardia, another parasite, was associated with a lower risk of Cryptosporidium diarrhea.\n\n**Implications**\n\nThe study's findings have important implications for public health policy in The Gambia and other developing countries. The researchers suggest that improving access to clean water and sanitation, and promoting good hygiene practices, such as storing drinking water safely and washing hands regularly, could help reduce the transmission of Cryptosporidium. They also recommend further research on the role of animals in the transmission of Cryptosporidium and the development of effective interventions to prevent the parasite.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the study highlights the importance of Cryptosporidium as a cause of diarrhea in young children in The Gambia, and emphasizes the need for improved access to clean water and sanitation, and good hygiene practices, to reduce the transmission of the parasite. The findings of this study have important implications for public health policy and practice in developing countries, and highlight the need for further research on the prevention and control of Cryptosporidium diarrhea.", "topic": "Cryptosporidiosis", "cat": []}
{"input": "Optic nerve degeneration caused by glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide . Patients affected by the normal-pressure form of glaucoma are more likely to harbor risk alleles for glaucoma-related optic nerve disease . We have performed a meta-analysis of two independent genome-wide association studies for primary open angle glaucoma ( POAG ) followed by a normal-pressure glaucoma ( NPG , defined by intraocular pressure ( IOP ) less than 22 mmHg ) subgroup analysis . The single-nucleotide polymorphisms that showed the most significant associations were tested for association with a second form of glaucoma , exfoliation-syndrome glaucoma . The overall meta-analysis of the GLAUGEN and NEIGHBOR dataset results ( 3 , 146 cases and 3 , 487 controls ) identified significant associations between two loci and POAG: the CDKN2BAS region on 9p21 ( rs2157719 [G] , OR\u200a=\u200a0 . 69 [95%CI 0 . 63\u20130 . 75] , p\u200a=\u200a1 . 86\u00d710\u221218 ) , and the SIX1/SIX6 region on chromosome 14q23 ( rs10483727 [A] , OR\u200a=\u200a1 . 32 [95%CI 1 . 21\u20131 . 43] , p\u200a=\u200a3 . 87\u00d710\u221211 ) . In sub-group analysis two loci were significantly associated with NPG: 9p21 containing the CDKN2BAS gene ( rs2157719 [G] , OR\u200a=\u200a0 . 58 [95% CI 0 . 50\u20130 . 67] , p\u200a=\u200a1 . 17\u00d710\u221212 ) and a probable regulatory region on 8q22 ( rs284489 [G] , OR\u200a=\u200a0 . 62 [95% CI 0 . 53\u20130 . 72] , p\u200a=\u200a8 . 88\u00d710\u221210 ) . Both NPG loci were also nominally associated with a second type of glaucoma , exfoliation syndrome glaucoma ( rs2157719 [G] , OR\u200a=\u200a0 . 59 [95% CI 0 . 41\u20130 . 87] , p\u200a=\u200a0 . 004 and rs284489 [G] , OR\u200a=\u200a0 . 76 [95% CI 0 . 54\u20131 . 06] , p\u200a=\u200a0 . 021 ) , suggesting that these loci might contribute more generally to optic nerve degeneration in glaucoma . Because both loci influence transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-beta ) signaling , we performed a genomic pathway analysis that showed an association between the TGF-beta pathway and NPG ( permuted p\u200a=\u200a0 . 009 ) . These results suggest that neuro-protective therapies targeting TGF-beta signaling could be effective for multiple forms of glaucoma .\nGlaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide [1] . Primary open angle glaucoma ( POAG ) , the most common form of glaucoma in the Western world , is an age-related , complex disease characterized by progressive irreversible degeneration of the optic nerve due to apoptotic retinal ganglion cell death [2] . In addition to age , epidemiologic studies have revealed multiple risk factors for the condition including elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , African-American race , family history and low ocular perfusion pressure [3]\u2013[5] . Of these , elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) is the only treatable risk factor; however , many individuals have IOP elevation without optic nerve disease [6] , and at least 33% of affected individuals have progressive retinal ganglion cell loss despite IOP measurements in the normal range ( less than 22 mmHg ) , a condition defined as normal-pressure glaucoma ( NPG ) [7] . Preventative or neuro-protective therapies for glaucoma are not yet available and little is known about the molecular events that influence susceptibility to glaucomatous optic nerve degeneration . POAG is genetically complex [8] . Linkage studies have identified over 20 genomic regions likely to contain POAG-related genes [9] . Importantly , genes that influence POAG risk overall may specifically contribute to separate independent biological processes affecting the disease outcome including regulation of IOP and retinal ganglion cell physiology . Individuals with elevated IOP without optic nerve disease may only carry genetic variants that influence IOP regulation , while individuals with NPG may primarily carry genetic variants that predispose to retinal ganglion cell death as the nerve degenerates in these patients without the added stress of elevated IOP . Recent genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) have identified several genetic risk factors for POAG overall , including single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) located in the CAV1/CAV2 intergenic region [10]\u2013[11] , and in the genomic regions containing the TMCO1 and CDKN2BAS genes [12] in a study of glaucoma patients with advanced optic nerve disease . Linkage studies have identified two genes that contribute to rare familial forms of NPG , OPTN ( optineurin ) [13] and TBK1 ( TANK-binding kinase ) [14] , and an intronic SNP in SRBD1 ( S1 RNA binding domain ) has been associated with NPG in a GWAS of 355 Japanese cases [15] . Genome-wide association studies have not yet identified genes commonly associated with normal-pressure glaucoma or with optic nerve disease in glaucoma . The identification of genes that influence glaucoma-related optic nerve degeneration is an important step toward the development of neuro-protective therapies that could substantially reduce the morbidity caused by this common disease , and such therapies could be relevant to optic nerve degeneration occurring in many chronic forms of glaucoma . To identify genes that predispose to glaucomatous optic nerve disease , we completed two GWAS for POAG: the GLAUGEN ( Glaucoma Genes and Environment ) GWAS that is part of the GENEVA ( GENEVA Genes Environment Association ) studies [16] and the NEIGHBOR ( NEI Glaucoma Human genetics collaBORation ) GWAS [17] . We then performed a meta-analysis as well as normal-pressure and high-pressure subgroup analyses of the combined dataset . To determine if the observed associations were specific to POAG or could generalize more broadly to optic nerve disease in other forms of glaucoma we selected the lead SNPs showing significant association in the normal-pressure glaucoma subgroup analysis , and tested them for association with glaucoma in a population of unrelated individuals with exfoliation syndrome glaucoma .\nAfter data cleaning , 976 cases and 1 , 140 controls collected from three study sites [Nurses' Health Study , Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Genetic Etiologies of Primary-Open angle Glaucoma Study ( GEP ) ] were analyzed for the GLAUGEN study , and 2 , 170 cases and 2 , 347 controls collected from 12 sites ( Table S1 ) were analyzed for the NEIGHBOR study . All cases and controls for both studies were residents of the continental United States and were of mainly European ancestry , which was confirmed by principal component analysis . The general characteristics for the cases and controls are shown in Table 1 . For POAG overall in the GLAUGEN GWAS , there were no SNPs with p-values that reached the genome-wide significance level of p\u200a=\u200a5\u00d710\u22128 ( Figure S1 and Figure S2 ) . In the NEIGHBOR overall POAG GWAS , there were seventeen SNPs that reached the genome-wide significance level of p\u200a=\u200a5\u00d710\u22128 . Sixteen of the significant SNPs were found in the CDKN2BAS gene region on chromosome 9p21 . 3 ( top SNP rs4977756 ( OR\u200a=\u200a0 . 66 [95% CI 0 . 59\u20130 . 73] , p value\u200a=\u200a7 . 4\u00d710\u221216 ) . The remaining significant SNP rs10483727 was located in the SIX1/SIX6 region on chromosome 14 ( OR\u200a=\u200a1 . 32 [95% CI 1 . 20\u20131 . 46] , p value\u200a=\u200a3 . 1\u00d710\u22128 ) . ( Figure S3 and Figure S4; Table S2 ) . Using METAL [18] , we conducted a meta-analysis of the GLAUGEN and NEIGHBOR datasets that included a total of 3 , 146 cases and 3 , 487 controls and found nineteen SNPs that achieved genome-wide significance for POAG overall ( Figure S5 ) : seventeen of them in the CDKN2BAS region , with the most significant SNP being rs2157719 ( OR\u200a=\u200a0 . 69 [95%CI 0 . 63\u20130 . 75] , p\u200a=\u200a1 . 86\u00d710\u221218 , and two SNPs in the SIX1/SIX6 region on chromosome 14q23 ( most significant SNP: rs10483727 , OR\u200a=\u200a1 . 32 [95%CI 1 . 21\u20131 . 43] , p\u200a=\u200a3 . 87\u00d710\u221211 ) ( Table S3 ) . A number of genomic regions , including the CDKN2BAS and SIX1/SIX6 regions have been previously associated with optic nerve quantitative parameters ( cup-to-disc ratio ( CDR ) and optic nerve area ) [19]\u2013[24] . Of these , only the CDKN2BAS and SIX1/SIX6 regions were significantly associated with glaucoma in the meta-analysis , although several other previously identified gene regions demonstrated suggestive associations including SALL1 , LRP1B and SIRPA ( Table 2 , Table S4 ) . To identify genetic risk factors primarily associated with optic nerve disease in glaucoma , we performed separate meta-analyses for NPG ( 720 cases ) and high-pressure glaucoma ( HPG , 1669 cases with IOP \u226522 mm Hg ) , ( 757 cases did not have untreated IOP data available ) . In the HPG meta-analysis , no SNPs , even those in the CDKN2BAS and SIX1/SIX6 regions , reached genome-wide significance ( Figure S6 ) . In the NPG meta-analysis , SNPs in two regions reached genome-wide significance , ( Figure 1 , Table 3 ) : thirteen SNPs in the CDKN2BAS region on 9p21 ( most significant SNP was rs2157719 , ( OR\u200a=\u200a0 . 58 [95% CI 0 . 50\u20130 . 67] , p\u200a=\u200a1 . 17\u00d710\u221212 ) ( Figure 2 , Figure S7 ) and three SNPs in an evolutionarily conserved region on chromosome 8q22 ( most significant SNP was rs284489 , OR\u200a=\u200a0 . 62 [95% CI 0 . 53\u20130 . 72] , p\u200a=\u200a8 . 88\u00d710\u221210 ) ( Figure 3 , Figure S8 ) . Using RT-PCR , we found that both LRP12 and ZFPM2 are expressed in the human optic nerve , as well as in other ocular tissues relevant to glaucoma ( Figure S11 ) . In mouse experiments using laser microdissection to selectively study specific layers of the retina , both LRP12 and ZFPM2 were expressed in the retinal ganglion cell and inner nuclear layers ( Figure S11 ) , making them good candidates for optic nerve susceptibility genes . We performed targeted resequencing of the LRP12 and ZFPM2 genes in 16 NPG patients and also analyzed the exomes of 50 POAG cases and 18 controls for DNA sequence variants in both genes ( Table S8 ) . None of the variants identified are expected to significantly affect gene expression or protein function . To determine if SNPs associated with NPG were associated with optic nerve degeneration in other types of glaucoma , we examined the association of the top SNPs in both the 9p21 and 8q22 genomic regions with optic nerve degeneration in exfoliation glaucoma , another form of open-angle glaucoma . Exfoliation syndrome , a condition predisposing to elevated intraocular pressure , is associated with genetic variants in LOXL1 [29] , however , these variants appear to contribute to the development of the exfoliation syndrome and not to optic nerve disease in POAG [30] . We found that rs2157719 in 9p21 was significantly associated with exfoliation glaucoma ( Table 4 ) , and rs284489 in 8q22 was also nominally associated with the same directionality of the association observed for NPG . Both the 9p21 and 8q22 regions could contribute to TGF-beta signaling . The 9p21 SNPs could effect expression of CDKN2BAS , a noncoding RNA that influences expression of CDKN2B , a member of the TGF-beta signaling pathway [31] . Using the SCAN database [32] , we found that the three 8q22 SNPs associated with NPG ( rs284489 , rs284495 and rs1521774 ) influence the expression of TSC22 ( TGF-beta stimulated clone 22 ) , which also modulates signaling by TGF-beta [33] . Using the PARIS ( Pathway Analysis by Randomization Incorporating Structure ) algorithm [34] , we found that the TGF-beta pathway ( KEGG , hsa04350 ) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ) overall was associated with NPG in our combined dataset ( permuted p\u200a=\u200a0 . 009 ) .\nUsing two large POAG case-control datasets , we have completed a meta-analysis for POAG followed by subgroup analyses for NPG and HPG . We have identified two genomic regions that are associated with NPG and showed that the lead SNP in each region is also associated with optic nerve disease in a second type of open-angle glaucoma ( exfoliation syndrome related glaucoma ) . The first region includes the CDKN2BAS gene on chromosome 9p21 , previously associated with cup-to-disc ratio ( CDR ) an optic nerve quantitative parameter , as well as POAG in candidate gene studies [20] , [35] , [36] and more recently in a GWAS using a sample of severely affected POAG patients [12] . In this study , we show that this gene region is associated with NPG suggesting that CDKN2BAS contributes to optic nerve degeneration in glaucoma . CDKN2BAS codes for an antisense RNA that regulates the expression of CDKN2B , which is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 ( CDK4 ) , a protein kinase that has a pivotal role in cell cycle progression [37] . The minor alleles of the NPG associated SNPs are protective , suggesting that these SNPs , or other variants in linkage disequilibrium with these SNPs , could influence CDKN2BAS and CDKN2B expression with corresponding changes in cyclin-dependent kinase activity that could result in retinal ganglion cell apoptosis . CDKN2BAS expression can also be influenced by interferon alpha [38] . As inflammation and autoimmunity may be factors contributing to glaucoma pathogenesis [39] , the regulation of CDKN2BAS expression by interferon could suggest a direct role for CDKN2BAS in glaucoma pathogenesis . CDKN2BAS also regulates the expression of CDKN2A , a gene previously shown to be down-regulated in other neurodegenerative disorders , including Alzheimer's disease , suggesting that regulation of CDKN2A expression by CDKN2BAS could also contribute to degeneration of the optic nerve in glaucoma [40] . The second region associated with NPG in this study is an evolutionarily conserved DNA segment on chromosome 8q22 with predicted regulatory function . This region partially overlaps with a POAG locus defined by a linkage study of a single large family with low intraocular pressure ( GLC1D ) [41] , and a second linkage study using multiple affected families stratified by age of disease onset [42] . The conserved region falls within a 630 Kb gene desert flanked by the LRP12 and ZFPM2 genes . ZFPM2 , also known as FOG2 , codes for a zinc finger protein that appears to contribute to cardiovascular development , and may have a role in ocular development [43] . ZFPM2 is expressed in the eye , and expression was observed to increase after injury to the optic nerve [44] . The LRP12 gene is a member of the LRP ( low-lipoprotein receptor ) gene family , with several members previously implicated in glaucoma . LRP1 is decreased in the optic neuropathy associated with Alzheimer's disease [45] , LRP1B is associated with optic nerve area [22] , a knock-out of LRP2 causes a glaucoma-like phenotype in zebrafish [46] , LRP4 expression is increased in response to retinal ischemia [47] , and expression of LRP10 and LRP11 is up-regulated in a rat model of glaucoma [48] , [49] . Importantly , LRP12 , previously known as ST7 , is a receptor for SMAD4 , a major regulator of the TGF-beta signaling pathway [50] . Interestingly , SMAD4 influences activity of TSC22 [51] . The 8q22 genomic region associated with NPG contains putative regulatory sites that appear to be active in two cell types that could contribute to glaucoma-related optic nerve disease , choroid plexus epithelial cells and non-pigmented ciliary body epithelial cells . The choroid plexus is responsible for formation of cerebral spinal fluid , and recent studies have suggested that low cerebral spinal fluid pressure , which could be caused by decreased formation of cerebral spinal fluid , may create a deleterious gradient across the lamina cribrosa in NPG mimicking a similar gradient induced by higher IOP in HPG [52] , [53] . The 8q22 regulatory region is also active in non-pigmented ciliary body epithelial cells , which affect ocular intraocular pressure through the production of aqueous humor ( a fluid that is similar in composition to cerebral spinal fluid ) . Both genomic regions identified in this study could contribute to regulation of TGF-beta signaling and our pathway analysis provides additional support for a role for TGF-beta signaling in glaucomatous optic nerve disease and retinal ganglion cell death . TGF-beta and other members of the TGF-beta signaling pathway have been previously implicated in glaucoma [54] , [55] , and genes participating in TGF-beta signaling are expressed in ocular structures that are involved in glaucoma , including the anatomic structures regulating IOP and the optic nerve [56]\u2013[58] . TGF-beta1 is up-regulated in optic nerve tissue in an animal model of glaucoma [59] , and mutations in LTBP2 ( latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 2 ) cause a rare autosomal recessive form of congenital glaucoma [60] . Collectively , these results suggest that therapies directed toward the regulation of TGF-beta signaling could protect the optic nerve from degeneration in glaucoma . The discovery of POAG genetic risk factors , especially the factors that predispose to glaucoma-related optic neuropathy , is a critical first step toward understanding the pathophysiology of POAG and the development of gene-based screening tests and neuro-protective therapies for this common blinding disease .\nThe institutional review boards of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary , Harvard School of Public Health , the Brigham and Women's Hospital , University of Pittsburgh , Johns Hopkins University , Duke University , University of West Virginia , University of Miami , University of Michigan , Stanford University , Marshfield Clinic , and the University of California , San Diego . approved this study . Combined meta-analysis of the GLAUGEN and NEIGHBOR datasets was done using the METAL [18] software package . We analyzed each study using logistic regression as described previously . Then , we combined the results using the inverse weighted variance method based on the regression coefficients and standard errors estimated from each study as implemented in the program METAL [18] . The GENOMICCONTROL option was set to ON to adjust for genomic inflation differences between the studies . Haplotype analysis ( logistic regression ) was performed with PLINK 1 . 07 [64] using sliding windows of 2\u20136 SNPs across the associated regions . Covariates in the model were the same as for the single-allele analyses . Pathway analysis was done using the Pathway Analysis by Randomization Incorporating Structure ( PARIS ) pathway analysis software package [34] . Genes comprising the transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-beta ) pathway were identified using the KEGG database ( hsa:04350 ) . SNPs were considered to reside in a pathway gene if the SNP fell within the ENSEMBLE genomic interval+/\u221250 kb to either side of the gene . If the overlap included another gene , the overlapping SNP ( s ) were counted once . A single-allele p-value of <0 . 05 was considered to be nominally significant and included in the PARIS analysis . Focused regional imputation was used to infer genotypes for SNPs not directly genotyped using MACH 1 . 0 [65] , [66] to impute to the 1000 genomes data , release 2010\u201306 . SNPs with a quality score ( Rsq ) of <0 . 5 were discarded before analysis . The resulting genotypes were analyzed using PLINK with the same covariates for each dataset as the non-imputed analyses . The meta-analysis procedure was also identical to that described above . Targeted resequencing using Sanger methods as described [69] was carried out on genes from the associated loci on chromosome 8 and chromosome 9 . All exons of LRP12 and ZFPM2 were sequenced in 16 NPG patients , and all exons of CDKN2BAS were sequenced in 11 cases carrying a protective haplotype including rs2157719 ( Table S6 ) . Genomic DNA was sequenced using primers designed to amplify the coding exons as well as the adjacent splice sites for both genes . PCR products were directly sequenced on the ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer ( Applied Biosystems ) with BigDye Terminators ( Applied Biosystems ) according to standard protocols . Methods and analysis for exome sequencing are described in Text S1 . Exfoliation cases were collected from the Massachusetts Eye and Ear infirmary glaucoma clinic ( cases ) and the comprehensive eye service ( controls in GLAUGEN or NEIGHBOR ) . All cases and controls were examined by a board certified ophthalmologist prior to study enrollment . The lead SNPs for each region associated with NPG were analyzed in 196 Caucasian patients with exfoliation syndrome , 104 of who also had glaucoma as defined as above . Single-SNP associations were analyzed using chi-square and logistic regression models adjusting for age .

Researchers have made a significant breakthrough in understanding the genetic factors that contribute to this debilitating disease. A recent study has identified two key regions in the human genome associated with normal-pressure glaucoma (NPG), a subtype of glaucoma that affects individuals with normal eye pressure.\n\n**The Study**\n\nThe research team conducted a meta-analysis of two large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving over 3,000 cases and 3,400 controls. They focused on primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common form of glaucoma in the Western world. The study revealed two significant associations: one with the CDKN2BAS gene region on chromosome 9p21 and another with a regulatory region on chromosome 8q22.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n1. **CDKN2BAS gene region**: The study found that the CDKN2BAS gene region is associated with NPG, suggesting that this gene contributes to optic nerve degeneration in glaucoma. The CDKN2BAS gene regulates the expression of CDKN2B, a protein that plays a crucial role in cell cycle progression.\n2. **Regulatory region on chromosome 8q22**: The study identified a regulatory region on chromosome 8q22 that is associated with NPG. This region is involved in the regulation of TGF-beta signaling, a pathway that has been implicated in glaucoma.\n3. **Association with exfoliation glaucoma**: The study found that the lead SNPs in both the CDKN2BAS and 8q22 regions are also associated with exfoliation glaucoma, another form of open-angle glaucoma.\n\n**Significance**\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for the development of neuro-protective therapies for glaucoma. The identification of genetic risk factors for NPG and the association with TGF-beta signaling suggest that therapies targeting this pathway could be effective in protecting the optic nerve from degeneration. This breakthrough could lead to the development of new treatments for glaucoma, potentially reducing the risk of blindness for millions of people worldwide.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe study provides new insights into the genetic factors that contribute to glaucoma, highlighting the importance of the CDKN2BAS gene region and the regulatory region on chromosome 8q22 in optic nerve degeneration. The association with TGF-beta signaling suggests a potential therapeutic target for glaucoma, offering hope for the development of new treatments for this debilitating disease.", "topic": "Glaucoma", "cat": []}
{"input": "Observers can rapidly perform a variety of visual tasks such as categorizing a scene as open , as outdoor , or as a beach . Although we know that different tasks are typically associated with systematic differences in behavioral responses , to date , little is known about the underlying mechanisms . Here , we implemented a single integrated paradigm that links perceptual processes with categorization processes . Using a large image database of natural scenes , we trained machine-learning classifiers to derive quantitative measures of task-specific perceptual discriminability based on the distance between individual images and different categorization boundaries . We showed that the resulting discriminability measure accurately predicts variations in behavioral responses across categorization tasks and stimulus sets . We further used the model to design an experiment , which challenged previous interpretations of the so-called \u201csuperordinate advantage . \u201d Overall , our study suggests that observed differences in behavioral responses across rapid categorization tasks reflect natural variations in perceptual discriminability .\nCategorization is perhaps one of our most critical visual functions as it allowed our ancestors to distinguish friend from foe and the edible from the inedible . Observers can rapidly extract meaning from brief presentations of complex visual scenes [1]\u2014far exceeding the best existing engineered artificial systems [2] . Observers can reliably perform a variety of categorization tasks [3] such as categorizing a scene as open , as outdoor , or as a beach . However , it has also been shown that there exist systematic differences in participants\u2019 behavioral responses across categorization tasks . In particular , categorizing a scene as open or navigable ( i . e . , attribute level ) necessitates shorter presentation times than categorizing a scene as a lake or a beach ( i . e . , basic level , see [4] ) . ( Note that our definition of basic-levelness follows the common usage in vision science ( see [5\u201313] ) and reflects a logical [14] rather than functional definition of the basic level . ) Similarly , participants appear to be faster and more accurate when categorizing a scene as outdoor ( i . e . , superordinate level ) compared to categorizing a scene at a basic level [7 , 9 , 11 , 13] . A very recent study further suggests that subordinate scene categorization is less sensitive and slower than basic level categorization [15] . Beyond the categorization of natural scenes , there exist systematic differences in behavioral responses for object categories across taxonomic levels with observers\u2019 subordinate-level categorization ( e . g . , pigeons vs . other birds ) being slower and less accurate than basic-level categorization ( e . g . , birds vs . non-birds , see [5] . Similarly , basic-level categorization ( e . g . , birds vs . dogs ) has been shown to be slower than superordinate categorization ( e . g . , animals vs . non-animals , see [16] ) . Participants tend to be faster and more accurate at categorizing faces at the superordinate level ( i . e . categorizing faces vs . non-faces ) compared with categorizing faces at the familiarity level ( famous vs . non-famous , see [6] ) . However , for both familiar faces and other individually-known familiar objects , categorization at the subordinate level is faster than at the basic level [17] . Similarly , there exist systematic differences in behavioral responses for different social inference tasks [12]: For instance , categorization at the level of intentionality is faster than categorization at the level of belief and personality . Such systematic behavioral differences across categorization tasks are often taken as suggestive evidence for an underlying hierarchical organization of categorization processes with some categorization tasks taking precedence over others [5\u201313] , but see also [18\u201320] . Overall , the past decade of research on visual categorization has produced a significant and rapidly increasing amount of data and , while systematic differences across categorization tasks have been well-characterized to date , little is known about the underlying mechanisms . In this study , we describe a computational model to account for variations in participants\u2019 behavioral responses ( both accuracy and reaction time ) across tasks and stimuli for the rapid categorization of natural scenes . Previous work has proceeded along two seemingly parallel paths ( see [21 , 22] for discussions ) with a nearly exclusive focus on modeling either visual representations ( see [23] for review ) or categorization and decision-making ( see [24] for review ) . Here , we implemented a single integrated paradigm that links perception with categorization processes . Formally , visual categorization corresponds to the process of associating visual stimuli xi = 1\u2026m to category labels yi = 1\u2026m to form ( xi , yi ) exemplar-label pairs . xi may be parametrized by a feature vector in a N-dimensional perceptual space x i = ( x i 1 , \u2026 x i k , \u2026 x i N ) . Fig 1A illustrates such a feature space for an hypothetical population of N = 2 feature detectors ( in practice , we expect N to be much larger ) . Learning to categorize visual stimuli requires learning a categorization boundary that best represents the relation between input images xi and their corresponding category labels yi . Once a categorization boundary had been learned , the classification of a stimulus depends on its position relative to the categorization boundary: One side of the categorization boundary will be associated with a target set of stimuli while the other side will be associated with the distractor set . An illustration for hypothetical decision boundaries corresponding to different taxonomic levels is shown in Fig 1B\u20131D . According to this computational framework , different categorization tasks correspond to different decision boundaries , which carve the same perceptual space , an idea that has motivated the development of most existing computational models of perceptual categorization ( see [22] for review ) . We used a rudimentary visual representation based on the \u201cgist\u201d algorithm [25] but other visual representations are possible ( see [23] for review; see also Discussion ) . We further used a large image database [26] to train and test machine learning classifiers ( regularized logistic regression ) and estimate the decision boundaries associated with many different scene categorization tasks . A task-dependent measure of perceptual discriminability can then be derived for a particular categorization task by considering the distance between individual stimuli and the categorization boundary ( Fig 2A ) . The basic intuition for this measure is that , for a particular categorization task , images that are closer to the categorization boundary will be harder to categorize than those that are further away leading to behavioral responses that are slower and less accurate . Furthermore , these values can be aggregated to yield estimates of accuracy for arbitrary sets of target and distractor stimuli ( Fig 2B ) . The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the perceptual discriminability of individual stimuli for a particular task is one of the main factors driving behavioral responses . While this hypothesis is built-in for many categorization models ( see [24] for review ) , it had so far only been tested with simple artificial stimuli where participants were trained to learn a new object category parametrized by two dimensions ( e . g . , [27] , but see also [28] for alternative models . ) However , this hypothesis has not yet been tested for well-learned , natural categories . We first found that model-derived discriminability values predicted well behavioral responses for different categorization tasks as reported in two published studies [4 , 11] . In addition , in experiment 1 , we were further able to show that the model accurately predicted variations in accuracy and reaction time at the level of individual stimuli within the context of a scene categorization task . We then used the model to test the hypothesis that the so-called \u201csuperordinate advantage\u201d [7 , 9 , 11 , 13] , whereby superordinate categorization is faster and more accurate than basic categorization , may reflect the greater perceptual discriminability of scenes at the superordinate vs . basic level . Consistent with this hypothesis , we first found that the model was consistent with the reported results of a published study on the superordinate advantage [9] . In experiment 2 , we further showed that it is possible to use model-derived discriminability values to sample stimuli and to effectively reverse the superordinate advantage , making participants superordinate categorization slower and less accurate than basic categorization , thus offering a possible perceptual explanation of the phenomenon . Overall , our results provide a computational-level explanation for the systematic variations in rapid categorization behavioral responses across taxonomic levels , suggesting that these differences may simply reflect natural variations in perceptual discriminability . Our study thus challenges several existing theories of visual processing and offers a vivid example of how computational models can help summarize existing data as well as plan and interpret novel experiments .\nWe have described an integrated paradigm that links perceptual processes with categorization processes . We used a large natural scene database to train and test machine learning classifiers in order to derive task-dependent perceptual discriminability values for individual images based on their distance to different categorization boundaries . We showed that the resulting model is consistent with a host of published results [4 , 9 , 11] . In addition , we also designed two experiments to demonstrate that it is possible to use the model to sample stimuli in order to manipulate participants\u2019 behavioral responses ( both accuracy and reaction times ) . In experiment 1 , we showed that sampling stimuli with increasing discriminability values ( i . e . with increasing distance to the category boundary ) yields behavioral responses that are increasingly fast and accurate . This suggests that the perceptual discriminability of individual stimuli for a particular task is one of the main factors driving behavioral responses . A few recent studies have hinted at the contribution of perceptual discriminability to categorization using isolated objects [37] , objects in clutter [23] and scenes [38 , 39] . It has been shown that the perceptual dissimilarity between categories directly affects the speed of superordinate-level vs . basic-level categorization in pigeons [40] . Early work on scene and face processing already hinted at this contribution by showing , for instance , that the stimulus content across spatial scales affects scene categorization performance [41] . Subsequent work has also shown that the manipulation of the phase and amplitude spectra of an image affects behavioral responses during scene superordinate categorization [42 , 43] . More recently , it has been shown that a low-level perceptual similarity measure based on stimulus contrast predicts the ease of categorization judgments for both artificial stimuli [44] and natural scenes [45] . Our study further demonstrates that it is possible to use modern machine learning tools and computer vision databases to predict human behavioral responses for many categorization tasks across taxonomic levels . In experiment 2 , we further showed that it is possible to use the model to sample stimuli in order to reverse the \u201csuperordinate advantage\u201d rendering participants\u2019 superordinate categorization arbitrarily slower and less accurate than basic categorization . Previous work has shown that it is possible to manipulate level-of-categorization effects by controlling the similarity between face stimuli [46] and the typicality of objects [47] . Here , we used the model to sample stimuli based on computed discriminability values , possibly making a superordinate categorization task harder compared to a basic level categorization task simply by sampling the right stimuli . Our results suggest that the superordinate advantage is at least in part driven by the perceptual discriminability of target and distractor stimulus sets . Simply put , superordinate-level categorization tasks tend to be easier than basic-level categorization tasks leading to observers\u2019 behavioral responses that are faster and more accurate . This is consistent with the somewhat higher accuracy of both connectionist models [48] and modern computer vision systems for categorization at the superordinate vs . basic level [49] and is consistent with the fact that children learn to categorize natural object categories at the superordinate level first [48 , 50] . Our results are consistent with the differentiation theory [51] and the Parallel Distributed Processing ( PDP ) theory [52] in that level-of-categorization effects as reported in multiple studies [5\u20137 , 9 , 11\u201313] arise , not because of privileged processing at particular taxonomic levels , but because of differences in perceptual discriminability across tasks . In addition , this perceptual explanation rules out an interpretation of level-of-categorization effects based on the \u201cglobal-to-specific\u201d theory of categorization , whereby categorization at more global ( coarser ) categorization stages need to be completed before categorization at more specific ( finer ) levels can begin . Hence , one would expect a basic advantage over subordinate categorization ( e . g . , detection preceding identification [53] ) as well as a superordinate and attribute advantage over basic and subordinate categorizations [4 , 5 , 11] . Our results demonstrate that observed differences in timing across categorization tasks do not necessarily reflect the fact that some categorization tasks take precedence over others ( see also [19 , 20] ) . While our results point to perceptual discriminability as playing a fundamental role in level-of-categorization effects , additional memory-related factors such as typicality are likely to affect rapid categorization . More generally , a complete model should also take into account known semantic contributions to visual categorization . One proposal is that mental representations of categories across taxonomic levels occupy nodes in a semantic network [54] . The rapid perceptual categorization mechanisms studied here may determine which nodes get activated first before activation spreads to other nodes enabling the slower retrieval of information at other levels of categorization [52] . The present study also has implications for models of category learning and models on the development of visual expertise . It is known that experts can override the supremacy of one level of categorization found in novices with their own level of expertise ( e . g . the subordinate level becomes faster for bird experts that are over-trained at the subordinate level , the basic-level becomes faster for Chinese character experts that are over-trained in discriminating characters at the basic level ( irrespective of font and writing style , see [22] for review ) . One simple explanation consistent with our results is that practice for a task leads to long-term perceptual learning that increases the discriminability between targets and distractors , making participants faster and more accurate . Despite its ability to account for behavioral responses , the proposed model remains relatively simple . We used a rudimentary visual representation based on the \u201cgist\u201d algorithm [25] and off-the-shelf machine learning classifiers ( see [39] for a similar model used to explain the scene categorization advantage when scenes contained consistent vs . inconsistent objects ) . However , the fact that a relatively simple ( V1-like ) model of feature computation , seems sufficient to account for behavioral responses does not necessary imply that rapid scene categorization is based on low-level visual processing . We have tested alternative visual representations based on common features used in computer vision and found all these models to be relatively correlated . This could possibly reflect a limitation inherent to the ever limited size of natural image databases [55] as well as possible inherent biases such as photographers selecting vantage points [56] . Note that such image bias is quite different from the \u201cnatural bias\u201d reported here in terms of differences in perceptual discriminability across categorization tasks , which is likely to reflect physical properties of our visual environment as opposed to biases in the image dataset per se . In addition , while the superordinate advantage has been described for other classes of stimuli beyond scenes such as animals [16] or faces [5 , 6] , we have here only considered the relevance of the model for scene categorization . The use of a similar framework for other type of classifications would be likely to require more elaborated visual representations . In theory , it should be relatively straightforward to test additional perceptual representations\u2014possibly reflecting higher level visual processes ( see [23] for a review ) . A possible neural correlate for decision boundaries includes neurons with category-like tuning found throughout the cortex such as within the ventral stream , the prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) and the parietal cortex [57] and/or attentional processes that would differentially modulate individual feature dimensions according to their task diagnosticity [58] . Perceptual spaces in practice tend to be more flexible than assumed in the model as novel features can be learned ( i . e . , the meaning of some of the dimensions may change and/or dimensions may be added as a result of learning and plasticity ) and perceptual spaces can be reshaped by task history and other cognitive factors [59] . Alternative categorization algorithms to the proposed decision boundary have been described based on either the distance to category prototypes [60] or the distance to individual exemplars [61] . The proposed discriminability measures based on the distance between stimuli and decision boundaries could be easily extended to distances to exemplars or prototypes [62] . While it is expected that a better model of the categorization process should improve the fit to behavioral data , it is unlikely to change any of our conclusions , since categorization models tend to produce similar behavioral predictions . Overall , our study provides a computational level explanation for systematic variations found in behavioral responses for rapid categorization tasks across taxonomic levels , challenging several existing theories of visual processing and suggesting , instead , that observed differences in behavioral responses may simply reflect natural variations in perceptual discriminability .", "output": " In this study, researchers have developed a computational model that links perceptual processes with categorization processes, focusing on the rapid categorization of natural scenes.

{"input": "Ultraconserved elements have been suggested to retain extended perfect sequence identity between the human , mouse , and rat genomes due to essential functional properties . To investigate the necessities of these elements in vivo , we removed four noncoding ultraconserved elements ( ranging in length from 222 to 731 base pairs ) from the mouse genome . To maximize the likelihood of observing a phenotype , we chose to delete elements that function as enhancers in a mouse transgenic assay and that are near genes that exhibit marked phenotypes both when completely inactivated in the mouse and when their expression is altered due to other genomic modifications . Remarkably , all four resulting lines of mice lacking these ultraconserved elements were viable and fertile , and failed to reveal any critical abnormalities when assayed for a variety of phenotypes including growth , longevity , pathology , and metabolism . In addition , more targeted screens , informed by the abnormalities observed in mice in which genes in proximity to the investigated elements had been altered , also failed to reveal notable abnormalities . These results , while not inclusive of all the possible phenotypic impact of the deleted sequences , indicate that extreme sequence constraint does not necessarily reflect crucial functions required for viability .\nEvolutionary conservation has become a powerful means for identifying functionally important genomic sequences [1 , 2] . Ultraconserved elements have been defined as a group of extremely conserved sequences that show 100% identity over 200 bp or greater between the human , mouse , and rat genomes [3] . This category of extreme evolutionary sequence conservation is represented by 481 sequences in the human genome , of which over half show no evidence of transcription . Further analysis of the distribution of these noncoding ultraconserved elements demonstrates that they tend to cluster in regions that are enriched for transcription factors and developmental genes [3] , and a limited number of functional studies suggest a role for some of these noncoding elements in gene regulation [4\u20136] . Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the extreme sequence constraint of ultraconserved elements , including strong negative selective pressure and/or reduced mutation rates [3] . The negative selection hypothesis postulates that crucial functions such as vital gene regulatory information is embedded within these sequences , while the reduced mutation rate hypothesis suggests that these sequences exist in a hyperrepaired or hypomutable state [3] . Recent analysis of human variation in these noncoding ultraconserved elements provides compelling evidence supporting negative selection as contributing to their extreme evolutionary conservation [7] . Furthermore , noncoding ultraconserved elements have also been shown to be significantly depleted in human segmental duplications and copy number variants , suggesting that disruption of their normal copy number may lead to reduced fitness [8] . In this study , we removed four carefully chosen noncoding ultraconserved elements in the mouse genome to directly explore a functional role for these elements in vivo .\nTo increase the probability of observing an associated phenotype in the ultraconserved null mice , we employed a variety of criteria in selecting the noncoding ultraconserved elements for deletion . We chose elements that showed tissue-specific in vivo enhancer activity in a mouse transgenic reporter assay that tended to recapitulate aspects of the expression pattern found in genes that were in their proximity ( Figure 1 ) [6] . Other factors that were taken into account in prioritizing elements for deletion included their proximity to genes whose inactivation or alteration in expression result in specific phenotypes that we could screen for in the ultraconserved element deletion mice ( Table 1 ) . Elements meeting most of these criteria were chosen for removal and included: uc248 , uc329 , uc467 , and uc482 ( Figure 1 ) [3] , representing 222 , 307 , 731 , and 295 bp , respectively , of 100% identity between human , mouse , and rat . All four noncoding ultraconserved elements were deleted from the mouse genome using standard mouse genetic engineering techniques , and removal was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot hybridization ( Protocol S1 ) . We first examined each line for the viability of homozygous/hemizygous knockout mice in mixed crosses , and observed that all four lines showed no reduction in the expected number of homozygous/hemizygous mice that were generated ( Tables 2 and 3 ) . Homozygous matings within the four lines revealed no significant differences in viability and litter size compared to the wild-type littermates ( Table 4 ) . We next examined body weight ( up to 10 wk of age; Figure 2 ) and survival ( up to 25 wk; see Materials and Methods ) , and found no significant differences compared to the wild-type littermates . Further analysis of a standard panel of 16 different clinical chemistry assays in each of the mouse lines detected only a few small differences compared to the wild-type littermates ( Figure S1 ) . Expression analysis of genes adjacent to each element by whole-mount in situ hybridization at embryonic day 11 . 5 ( e11 . 5 ) revealed no apparent differences between null embryos and their wild-type littermates , except for a moderate reduction in forebrain expression of SRY-box containing gene 3 ( Sox3 ) in uc482 null embryos ( Figure S2 ) . Quantification by real-time PCR suggested a slight reduction in Sox3 e11 . 5 head expression that was , however , insignificant ( 29 . 63 in wild-types compared to 23 . 66 in nulls , corresponding to 18S RNA expression; p = 0 . 64 , unpaired t-test ) . General pathological analysis of 6-wk-old mice revealed no distinct differences compared to the wild-type littermates ( Table S1 ) , with one exception . The exception was one uc329 homozygous male having unilateral renal agenesis . Additional analysis of 102 uc329 homozygous null mice revealed a total of two mice ( including the initial propositus ) with one kidney , compared to none within the 30 uc329 wild-type littermates that were screened . Unilateral renal agenesis is estimated to occur in 1 to 1 , 000 live births in humans [9] and is asymptomatic and unassociated with a reduction in survival rate [10] . Possible explanations for unilateral renal agenesis in \u223c2% of uc329 homozygous null mice in this study include a spontaneous event unassociated with the deleted element or a low penetrance phenotype caused by the absence of this element . In addition to the above general screens , we screened each of these mouse lines for phenotypes specifically associated with the inactivation or dosage abnormality of the genes in proximity to the deleted ultraconserved elements . uc248 is bracketed by the genes doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1 ( DMRT1 ) and doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 3 ( DMRT3 ) ( Figure 1A ) . In humans , haploinsufficiency due to chromosomal aberrations within this region leads to XY sex reversal [11] . In mice , Dmrt1 homozygous knockouts exhibit defects in testicular development [12] , while Dmrt3 function is unknown . In order to identify the phenotype associated with Dmrt3 deficiency for these studies , we deleted Dmrt3 from the mouse genome . All Dmrt3 null homozygous mice died from starvation at 2 mo of age due to dental malocclusions , and in addition some of the males exhibited male sexual development abnormalities ( N . Ahituv , unpublished data ) . Based on these results , we extensively phenotyped uc248 homozygous null mice for sexual and dental abnormalities . Pathological analysis of both male and female sexual organs and teeth in 6-wk-old uc248 null mice revealed no obvious defects ( Table S1 ) . In addition , heterozygous and homozygous crosses exhibited no reduction in expected homozygous offspring ( Tables 2 and 4 ) . uc467 , the longest solitary noncoding ultraconserved element in the human genome ( 731 bp ) , lies inside the last intron of polymerase ( DNA directed ) , alpha 1 ( POLA1 ) adjacent to the aristaless related homeobox ( ARX ) gene ( Figure 1C ) . Mutations in ARX in humans lead to a wide range of neurological and sexual development disorders [13 , 14] , while hemizygous Arx null male mice die shortly after birth and have small brains and male sexual development abnormalities [15] . In addition , a duplication of this region in mice , caused by insertional mutagenesis , leads to embryonic lethality due to exencephaly accompanied by anophthalmia [16] . Detailed pathological examination of the reproductive organs and neuroanatomical examination of the brains of uc467 null mice revealed no apparent abnormalities ( Table S1 ) . In addition , the mice showed no obvious differences in the offspring expected from the hemizygous \u00d7 heterozygous and hemizygous \u00d7 homozygous crosses ( Tables 3 and 4 ) . uc329 lies in the middle of an 80-kb intronic region of the hypothetical gene 0610012H03Rik in a region adjacent to the reticulocalbin 1 , EF-hand calcium binding domain ( RCN1 ) gene and two developmental transcription factors , Wilms tumor 1 ( WT1 ) and paired box 6 ( PAX6 ) ( Figure 1B ) . Mutations in humans in WT1 and PAX6 respectively cause Wilms tumor and type 2 aniridia , while chromosomal deletions encompassing all four genes lead to WAGR syndrome . Mouse knockouts generated for Wt1 and Pax6 have a variety of phenotypes , the most notable being kidney and eye abnormalities , respectively . Detailed pathological analysis of the kidneys and eyes of the uc329 null mice revealed no significant differences compared to the wild-type littermates ( Table S1 ) , other than the \u223c2% unilateral renal agenesis discussed above . Clinical chemistry tests revealed slightly higher urea nitrogen levels compared to the wild-type littermates ( 33 . 16 versus 26 . 16 mg/dl; p = 0 . 032 , unpaired t-test; Figure S1 ) , while creatinine levels , which are a more specific measure for kidney function , were similar to those in the wild-type littermates ( 0 . 25 versus 0 . 22 mg/dl; p = 0 . 165 , unpaired t-test; Figure S1 ) . uc482 resides in a gene desert between the ATPase , Class VI type 11C ( ATP11C ) and SRY ( sex determining region Y ) -box 3 ( SOX3 ) genes ( Figure 1D ) . Human SOX3 mutations lead to X-linked mental retardation with isolated growth hormone deficiency [17] and hypopituitarism [18] , while SOX3 dosage defects are suggested to cause hypopituitarism [18] and hypoparathyroidism [19] . In mice , deletion of Sox3 results in sexual development and pituitary abnormalities [20 , 21] . Pathological analysis of the reproductive organs of uc482 null mice revealed no significant abnormalities ( Table S1 ) , and hemizygous \u00d7 heterozygous and hemizygous \u00d7 homozygous crosses exhibited no reduction in expected homozygous/hemizygous offspring ( Tables 3 and 4 ) . Growth hormone abnormalities would be expected to lead to body weight irregularities , none of which were detected ( Figure 2 ) . Calcium levels were also normal ( Figure S1 ) , supporting a lack of marked abnormalities in parathyroid gland function .\nBased on the compelling evidence that ultraconserved elements are conserved due to functional constraint , it has been proposed that their removal in vivo would lead to a significant phenotypic impact [7 , 8] . Accordingly , our results were unexpected . It is possible that our assays were not able to detect dramatic phenotypes that under a different setting , for instance , outside the controlled laboratory setting , would become evident . Moreover , possible phenotypes might become evident only on a longer timescale , such as longer generation time . It is also possible that subtler genetic manipulations of the ultraconserved elements might lead to an evident phenotype due to a gain-of-function-type mechanism . All four elements examined in this study demonstrated in vivo enhancer activity when tested in a transgenic mouse assay ( Figure 1 ) [6] , which would suggest regulatory element redundancy as another possible explanation for the lack of a significant impact following the removal of these specific elements . Just as gene redundancy has been shown to be responsible for the lack of phenotypes associated with many seemingly vital gene knockouts , regulatory sequence redundancy [22] can similarly provide a possible explanation for the lack of a marked phenotype in this study . While our studies have not defined a specific need for the extreme sequence constraints of noncoding ultraconserved elements , they have ruled out the hypothesis that these constraints reflect crucial functions required for viability .\nThe basic technology used for gene targeting and screening has been described previously [23] . Briefly , the four selected ultraconserved elements were removed in W4/129S6 mouse embryonic stem cells ( Taconic , http://www . taconic . com/ ) by standard replacement of a LoxP-flanked neomycin cassette . To avoid potential regulatory effects due to the neomycin gene cassette , we subsequently removed it by Cre-mediated recombination of LoxP sites in the embryonic stem cells . All positive colonies in each stage were confirmed by PCR and Southern analysis ( Protocol S1 ) and then injected into C57BL/6J blastocyst stage embryos . Chimeric mice were subsequently crossed to C57BL/6J mice , generating agouti offspring that were heterozygous/hemizygous for the ultraconserved element deletion and were intercrossed to generate homozygous ultraconserved null mice . Genotyping was carried out using standard PCR techniques ( Protocol S1 ) . Eight males and eight females from each line and wild-type littermates were analyzed for survival up to 25 wk . Mice were housed in a temperature-controlled room under a 12-h light/dark cycle , given free access to water , and fed ad libitum on a standard chow . No lethality was observed for any of the strains during the period of study . Serum samples from at least six males and six females at 10\u201314 wk of age from each line were analyzed using the automated spectrophotometric chemistry analyzer Hitachi 917 at Marshfield Laboratories ( http://www . marshfieldlaboratories . org/ ) following standard protocols . Four e11 . 5 wild-type embryos were analyzed for each gene . Genes that were positive for expression at this time point were further analyzed for expression differences using four homozygous null and four wild-type littermates at e11 . 5 . Briefly , embryos were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by methanol washes . Whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization was carried out using standard protocols [24] with antisense digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes . The following vectors were used as templates for probes: Dmrt1 ( kind gift from D .

Stained embryos were analyzed using a Leica ( http://www . leica . com/ ) MZ16 microscope and photographed with a Leica DC480 camera . Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen , http://www . invitrogen . com/ ) from the heads of four uc482 homozygous/hemizygous null and four wild-type littermates at e11 . 5 , and pooled separately . Following reverse transcription with SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System ( Invitrogen ) , real-time PCR was performed using Sox3-specific primers ( forward: agcgcctggacacgtacac; reverse: atgtcgtagcggtgcatct ) , QuantumRNA Universal 18S ( Ambion , http://www . ambion . com/ ) , and the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems , http://www . appliedbiosystems . com/ ) on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System ( Applied Biosystems ) . All procedures and calculations were carried out according to manufacturers' recommendations . Two male and two female 6-wk-old mice from each knockout line and wild-type littermates were submitted to the Comparative Pathology Laboratory at the University of California Davis . Tissues were fixed in 10% phosphate buffered formalin for at least 24 h and processed using routine methods to Hematoxylin-and-Eosin-stained sections and subsequently analyzed for any abnormalities .\nThe Entrez Gene ( http://www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/sites/entrez ? db=gene ) accession numbers for the mouse genes discussed in this paper are Arx ( 11878 ) , Atp11c ( 54668 ) , Dmrt1 ( 50796 ) , Dmrt2 ( 226049 ) , Dmrt3 ( 240590 ) , Pax6 ( 18508 ) , Pola1 ( 18968 ) , Rcn1 ( 19672 ) , Sox3 ( 20675 ) , and Wt1 ( 22431 ) .

Remarkably, all four lines of mice lacking these UCEs were viable and fertile, and no critical abnormalities were observed.\n\nFurther targeted screens, informed by the abnormalities observed in mice in which genes in proximity to the investigated elements had been altered, also failed to reveal notable abnormalities. These results suggest that extreme sequence constraint does not necessarily reflect crucial functions required for viability.\n\nThe study provides compelling evidence that UCEs may not be as essential as previously thought, and that their extreme conservation may not be solely due to negative selection or reduced mutation rates. The findings have important implications for our understanding of the evolution and function of non-coding sequences in the genome.\n\nThe researchers used standard gene targeting and screening techniques to remove the UCEs from mouse embryonic stem cells and then injected the modified cells into blastocyst stage embryos. The resulting chimeric mice were crossed to generate homozygous UCE null mice. The mice were then analyzed for a variety of phenotypes, including survival, body weight, clinical chemistry assays, and pathological analysis.\n\nWhile the study did not define a specific need for the extreme sequence constraints of non-coding UCEs, it did rule out the hypothesis that these constraints reflect crucial functions required for viability. The findings suggest that regulatory sequence redundancy may be responsible for the lack of a marked phenotype in this study, similar to how gene redundancy has been shown to be responsible for the lack of phenotypes associated with many seemingly vital gene knockouts.\n\nOverall, the study provides important insights into the evolution and function of non-coding sequences in the genome and challenges the prevailing view that UCEs are essential for viability.

{"input": "Repurposing FDA-approved drugs with the aid of gene signatures of disease can accelerate the development of new therapeutics . A major challenge to developing reliable drug predictions is heterogeneity . Different gene signatures of the same disease or drug treatment often show poor overlap across studies , as a consequence of both biological and technical variability , and this can affect the quality and reproducibility of computational drug predictions . Existing algorithms for signature-based drug repurposing use only individual signatures as input . But for many diseases , there are dozens of signatures in the public domain . Methods that exploit all available transcriptional knowledge on a disease should produce improved drug predictions . Here , we adapt an established meta-analysis framework to address the problem of drug repurposing using an ensemble of disease signatures . Our computational pipeline takes as input a collection of disease signatures , and outputs a list of drugs predicted to consistently reverse pathological gene changes . We apply our method to conduct the largest and most systematic repurposing study on lung cancer transcriptomes , using 21 signatures . We show that scaling up transcriptional knowledge significantly increases the reproducibility of top drug hits , from 44% to 78% . We extensively characterize drug hits in silico , demonstrating that they slow growth significantly in nine lung cancer cell lines from the NCI-60 collection , and identify CALM1 and PLA2G4A as promising drug targets for lung cancer . Our meta-analysis pipeline is general , and applicable to any disease context; it can be applied to improve the results of signature-based drug repurposing by leveraging the large number of disease signatures in the public domain .\nLung cancer accounts for the largest number of cancer-related deaths , and the 5-year survival rate ( across all stages ) is only 16% [1]; there is an urgent need for new therapeutics to help treat it . Over the past two decades , the application of high-throughput technologies has led to the rapid accumulation of comprehensive and diverse public datasets cataloguing genome-wide molecular alterations seen with lung cancer or with drug administration . Integrative computational methods that mine these data are fast , cheap , and can complement traditional methods of drug screening; complementary information in these distinct resources can be leveraged to develop comprehensive in silico screens for novel cancer therapeutics [2] . One such resource , the Connectivity Map ( CMap ) , which is the focus of our analyses , catalogues the transcriptional responses to drug treatment in human cell lines for over a thousand small molecules [3] . CMap has been successfully applied to identify novel therapeutics for a diverse set of indications including various cancers [4 , 5] , and most recently osteoarthritic pain [6] and muscle atrophy [7] . CMap was applied in three earlier studies to identify novel therapeutics for lung cancer . Wang et al . [8] combined two microarray data sets to create a single transcriptional signature of lung adenocarcinoma and screened it against CMap . They tested one of their drug hits ( 17-AAG ) in vitro and found that it inhibited growth in two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines . Ebi et al . [9] constructed a transcriptional signature of survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma; CMap analysis identified several drugs that might improve outcome . The authors experimentally confirmed the growth inhibitory activity of several drug hits , including rapamycin , LY-294002 , prochlorperazine , and resveratrol . Jahchan et al . [10] combined two public datasets on small cell lung cancer into a single signature and screened it against the drug profiles in CMap . In vitro experiments confirmed the inhibitory activity of many of their top hits , and in vivo testing showed promising results for imipramine and promethazine . Nearly every previous analysis using Connectivity Map data to link drugs to diseases has done so with the CMap online tool ( http://broadinstitute . org/cmap/ ) . The CMap tool takes as input a set of up-regulated probe sets and a set of down-regulated probe sets , and returns a list of drugs that reverts or mimics those gene expression changes . However , for most diseases , not one but many\u2014often dozens\u2014of distinct gene signatures are available . For example , the cancer-specific database Oncomine ( version 4 . 4 ) currently stores mRNA data from 566 different studies [11] . As the CMap tool only deals with one gene signature at a time , the question of how best to take advantage of the information in a large collection of disease signatures remains an important open problem . Since different disease signatures can overlap poorly from study to study [2] , combining information across many signatures has the potential to improve the performance of drug repurposing algorithms . While a few studies have used multiple disease signatures in CMap analysis , e . g . , [7 , 8] ( though with one exception [12] , they used only two or three signatures ) , they have all relied on essentially the same strategy of collapsing all disease signatures into a single meta-signature ( by e . g . , intersecting lists of significant genes from different studies , as in [7] ) and querying the CMap data with this signature . Since each of the individual disease signatures was constructed using dozens or even hundreds of microarrays , there is fairly strong evidence for every gene in each signature . In contrast , the drug response data in CMap is noisy: the 1 , 309 drugs have each been tested only a median of 4 times ( 4 treatment microarrays ) . This noise has consequences: previous work has shown that even small changes in the input gene signature can lead to large changes in the list of drugs identified as significant by CMap analysis ( with the sscMap program ) [13 , 14] . Here we propose an alternative strategy for connecting a set of disease gene signatures to drugs , CMapBatch . Rather than collapsing all the gene signatures in the set into a single gene signature , we propose to screen each disease signature separately against CMap to produce a set of ranked lists of drug candidates . Next , we apply meta-analysis to identify which drugs are consistently ranked as the best candidates across all disease signatures . Thus , we perform the meta-analysis at a later step: our method combines lists of drugs rather than lists of genes . We show that this strategy returns more stable sets of top drug candidates compared to when individual gene signatures are used . Next , we applied CMapBatch to lung cancer . We used three steps to identify and prioritize new lung cancer therapeutics . First , we conducted a meta-analysis using CMapBatch to identify drugs that reverse the transcriptional changes seen with lung cancer across 21 gene signatures ( see Table 1 ) . We identified 247 CMap drugs that consistently counter the gene changes that occur with lung cancer . Second , we performed in silico validation of drug candidates with the NCI-60 growth inhibition data . This validation supported our method: drug candidates identified by CMapBatch were significantly more likely to slow growth in nine lung cancer cell lines than other CMap drugs . Third , we implemented data integration for drug prioritization . We identified common protein targets of significant drugs , and used chemical structure similarity and drug-target relationships to prioritize candidate therapeutics .\nOur CMapBatch meta-analysis pipeline comprises the following steps ( Fig . 1 ) : For each individual lung cancer signature ( tumour vs . normal comparison ) , we calculate mean connectivity scores for 1 , 309 small molecules ( as previously described [3] ) . Connectivity scores range between -1 and 1; a large , negative mean connectivity score indicates that drug treatment reverses many of the gene changes seen with lung cancer . We use the mean connectivity score to construct a ranked list of drugs for each signature . We combine the ranked lists of drugs into a single matrix , and identify drugs that were consistently highly ranked across all signatures using the Rank Product method [15] ( see Materials and Methods ) . Our analyses are based on 21 previously published gene expression signatures of lung cancer obtained from Oncomine [11] and CDIP , the Cancer Data Integration Portal ( http://ophid . utoronto . ca/cdip/ ) . The samples used to derive each signature have diverse histologies , and mRNA levels were measured on various commercial platforms . Previous work has shown that CMap analysis of different gene signatures for the same disease can return very different lists of drug candidates [14] . This is undesirable , if perhaps unsurprising as gene signatures themselves can be highly variable [2] . Consistent with previous findings , we found that when we retrieved lists of the top 50 drugs for each of the 21 different gene signatures of lung cancer ( using the CMap online tool ) , overlap was poor . The median number of drug candidates present in top 50 drug candidate lists from two different signatures was only 22 ( Fig . 2 in blue ) . Repeating the same test using lung cancer signatures of the same type\u201410 adenocarcinoma signatures\u2014did not lead to much improvement . For adenocarcinoma , the median number of drugs identified by two signatures was 26 ( Fig . 2 in gray ) , but the difference is not statistically significant . We also tested whether the signatures were heterogeneous by computing , for each signature , the median number of drugs shared with all other signatures . For 19 signatures , the median number of shared drugs between any pair of them was similar , varying from 16\u201329 . But there were two outliers: an adenocarcinoma signature [16] that shares zero drugs with any other signature , and a signature of carcinoid tumours [17] that shares a median of only three drugs with other signatures . Removing these two heterogeneous signatures from the signature set boosts the median number of drugs common to any pair of signatures to 24 , but again this difference is not statistically significant . Next , we sought to determine whether aggregating the information from a large set of signatures with CMapBatch would lead to a more stable list of top drug candidates . For this test , we randomly assigned the 21 lung cancer gene signatures to two groups , one with 10 and the other with 11 signatures . We ran CMapBatch separately on the two disjoint sets of signatures , and compared lists of the top 50 drugs identified for each set . We repeated this test 100 times . We found that CMapBatch consistently identifies the same drugs as combatting lung cancer , even when it is trained on completely different sets of lung cancer signatures . A median of 39 drugs were found to be common to both the lists of top 50 drugs identified from two disjoint sets of signatures ( Fig . 2 in green ) , significantly more than are found with individual gene signatures ( Wilcox test P << 0 . 01 ) . This key finding is not sensitive to choice of threshold; using the top 25 or top 100 drugs as an alternative cut-off , CMapBatch again recovers a significantly higher number of drugs ( P << 0 . 01; S1 Fig ) . For the remainder of this paper , we focus on characterizing and prioritizing the full set of significant drugs identified by CMapBatch using all 21 gene signatures of lung cancer . As an independent validation of our results , we used growth inhibition data from the NCI-60 collection [18] to determine whether the drug candidates we identified are better at slowing growth in lung cancer cell lines . For all our NCI-60 analyses we used the nine lung cancer cell lines in which over 100 Connectivity Map drugs were tested ( see Methods ) . None of these nine cell lines were included in the CMap dataset , so they provide an independent test of the effectiveness of our predicted drugs for lung cancer . The Tanimoto coefficient quantifies the chemical structure similarity between two molecules [23]; here , we call two molecules structurally similar if this number exceeds 0 . 8 . We found that eleven drugs that reverse the transcriptional changes observed in lung cancer were structurally similar to one or more drugs in TOP ( Fig . 4 , right; S3 Table ) . These drugs were not evaluated as part of the NCI-60 project; furthermore , 9 of 11 appear in fewer than 20 Pubmed abstracts concerned with cancer . These are novel candidate anticancer therapeutics identified by our computational screen . Further cell-based screens and experimental characterization would be required to determine whether these structurally similar drugs show true anticancer activity . We used drug-target data from DrugBank [24] and ChemBank [25] ( as provided in MANTRA [26] ) to construct a drug-drug interaction network on the set of CMap drugs; two drugs are linked by an edge if they share one or more protein targets ( Fig . 5A ) . In total , 83 of the significant drugs were present in this network ( the protein targets of many drugs are still unknown ) , including 9 TOP drugs . Thirty-eight significant drugs that were not tested in the NCI-60 collection share one or more protein targets with a TOP drug ( S4 Table; Fig . 5A , purple and green nodes ) , indicating they may have a similar mode of action and may inhibit growth in lung cancer cell lines . However , since drug target databases do not systematically evaluate a range of drug concentrations and off-target effects , this evidence should only be considered preliminary . Seven of these 38 drugs were also found to be structurally similar to TOP drugs ( Fig . 5A , green nodes ) : prochlorperazine , promazine , trifluoperazine , fluspirilene , phenindione , vidarabine , and chlorpromazine . As these drugs are linked to TOP drugs by two separate lines of evidence , they are promising candidates for further experimental validation . The largest connected component in the drug-target interaction network comprised 72 drugs , which is significantly larger ( P << 0 . 01 ) than what would be expected by chance; random sets of 83 drugs in the drug-drug network yield largest connected components with a median size of only 42 drugs ( Fig . 5B ) . This indicates that some gene targets are overrepresented among significant drugs; these genes may be valuable drug targets for lung cancer . We applied the hypergeometric test to each gene target of a significant drug and identified ten over-represented targets ( P < 0 . 05; Table 2 ) . The top over-represented gene is Calmodulin 1 ( CALM1 ) , a gene involved in the cell cycle and in signal transduction; it\u2019s a target of 9 CMap drugs , and we found that 8 of these reverse the transcriptional changes seen with lung cancer . Recent research suggests that CBP501 , a drug currently in Phase II clinical trials for NSCLC , may sensitize tumors to the chemotherapeutic agents bleomycin and cisplatin by inhibiting CALM1 [27] . Thus , other significant drugs that target CALM1 may also enhance the effect of chemotherapy . The 8 drugs we identified are bepridil , felodipine , flunarizine , fluphenazine , loperamide , phenoxybenzamine , pimozide , and miconazole . The second-most overrepresented gene is PLA2G4A , whose protein product is a member of the cytosolic phospholipase A2 family . Cytosolic phospholipase A2 ( cPLA2 ) has been previously implicated in cancer progression and metastasis . Furthermore , in a mouse model of lung cancer , the inhibition of cPLA2 activity led to delayed tumour growth [28] . There are 4 drugs targeting PLA2G4A included in the CMap collection , and all 4 significantly reverse lung cancer gene changes in our analyses: flunisolide , fluocinonide , fluorometholone , and medrysone . We used the CMap gene expression profiles from before and after drug treatment to calculate the number of genes differentially expressed in response to a drug , for each of the 1 , 309 drugs in the collection ( see Materials and Methods ) . We found that significant drugs affect a median of 8 . 5 genes , while other CMap drugs affect only a median of 3 ( Fig . 6; Wilcox test P << 0 . 01 ) . We investigated the top drugs that revert expression changes in different lung cancer subtypes by running CMapBatch on the two largest signature subsets in our collection , adenocarcinoma ( 10 signatures ) and squamous cell carcinoma ( 6 signatures ) . We found a very high concordance among top drugs; 79 drugs are common to the top 100 drugs lists for adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma ( Fig . 7 ) . Furthermore , all 79 drugs are significant in the full 21-signature meta-analysis ( FDR < 5% ) . This finding is consistent with previous work showing that a common transcriptional program contributes to the molecular signature of many diverse cancers [29] , and that CMap predicts similar sets of drugs for some cancers originating from different tissues [12] . Many of the current FDA approved drugs for lung cancer are also approved for other cancers , e . g . methotrexate , cisplatin , etoposide , etc [30] . We selected the antipsychotic drug pimozide for further in vitro validation . Pimozide is both a member of the set of TOP drugs and an inhibitor of CALM1 , the most overrepresented protein amongst all targets of significant drugs . We conducted experiments in four lung cancer cell lines that all overexpress CALM1 , A549 , H460 , HCC4006 , and H1437 ( Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia data [31] ) , to test the growth slowing effects of pimozide . Using the MTT assay , we found that pimozide showed significant anticancer activity in each of the four cell lines ( P \u2264 0 . 05; Fig . 8 ) . This validates our computational prediction that pimozide may help treat lung cancer . Since drug-target databases predict that pimozide inhibits CALM1 , we assayed CALM1 expression before and after drug treatment in A549 and H460 cells to determine whether CALM1 inhibition might mediate the anticancer activity , but found no significant difference . We also tested whether pimozide was synergistic with cisplatin using the Chou-Talalay method[32 , 33] in all four cell lines , but our results were negative . Our experiments confirm that pimozide shows some initial promise as a lung cancer therapeutic , but the mechanism of its anticancer activity is unknown and appears to be CALM1-independent .\nFor many diseases , including several cancers , dozens of distinct transcriptional signatures are available . We developed CMapBatch to efficiently integrate these data with the Connectivity Map to automate drug repurposing and identify stable lists of candidate therapeutics . We applied it to perform the largest in silico drug screen on lung cancer transcriptomes . In total , we identified 247 candidate therapeutics , and for many of these we were able to obtain additional compelling evidence from high-throughput NCI-60 data and databases of known drug targets . CMapBatch provides a principled approach to combining drug results across multiple gene signatures of disease . Several simple extensions may be appropriate in different applications . For example , weights could be incorporated so that some studies are weighted more highly than others . Also , instead of a meta-analysis across signatures , each of which incorporates multiple patient samples , CMapBatch could be extended to a meta-analysis across all individual samples . We anticipate that CMapBatch and similar methods that can take advantage of the full set of public data on disease will help speed the discovery and development of new medicines .\nCode for all analyses was written in R 2 . 14 . 0 . We converted gene names to HG-U133A probeset IDs for Connectivity Map analysis using the hgu133a . db ( Bioconductor 2 . 8 ) . The drug-target and mode of action networks were analyzed using igraph ( Bioconductor 2 . 8 ) and visualized using NAViGaTOR 2 . 3 . 2 [34] , and drug structures were visualized with PyMOL [35] . We calculated Tanimoto similarity for all pairs of 1 , 148 CMap drugs for which PubChem IDs were available using the PubChem Chemical Structure Clustering Tool [36] . We have made the CMapBatch meta-analysis workflow available as an R script from http://www . cs . utoronto . ca/~juris/data/cmapbatch . We restricted our analyses to the NCI-60 GI50 ( 50% growth inhibition ) data and to those lung cancer cell lines where at least 100 Connectivity Map drugs were tested ( there were nine of these , all NSCLC: NCI-H23 , NCI-H522 , A549/ATCC , EKVX , NCI-H226 , NCI-H322M , NCI-H460 , HOP-62 , HOP-92 ) . As different GI50 thresholds were used to denote minimal activity in response to a drug for different concentration ranges , we filtered the data to make results comparable across drugs . We retained only those entries with an LCONC ( maximum log10 concentration ) of-4 and where the drug concentration was measured in units of molarity .", "output": " In a groundbreaking study, researchers have developed a new method to repurpose FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of lung cancer, a disease that accounts for the highest number of cancer-related deaths and has a dismal 16% 5-year survival rate.

ZIKV has a positive-sense , single-stranded RNA genome , approximately 11 kilobases in length that encodes three structural proteins: the capsid ( C ) , premembrane/membrane ( prM ) , and envelope ( E ) , and seven non-structural proteins ( NS1 , NS2A , NS2B , NS3 , NS4A , 2K , NS4B , and NS5 ) . Based on a genetic study using nucleotide sequences derived from the NS5 gene , there are three ZIKV lineages: East African , West African , and Asian [2] [3] . ZIKV emerged out of Africa and previously caused outbreaks of febrile disease in the Yap islands of the Federated states of Micronesia [4] , French Polynesia [5] , and Oceania . Currently , nearly all Latin American countries have experienced local transmission ZIKV [6] , and there are now reports of mosquito transmitted ZIKV in North America . The current outbreak in the Americas is cause for great concern , because of the fast and uncontrolled autochthonous spread , and unique ability among ZIKV to transmit through sexual contact [7] . Clinically , infection with ZIKV resembles dengue fever and several other arboviral diseases [8] , but infection during pregnancy has been linked to fetal neurological syndromes and congenital malformation [9] . Alarmingly , the rate of microcephaly ( small head , reduced brain size , impaired neurocognitive development ) in infants born has increased significantly ( 20-fold in 2015 ) in areas with high ZIKV incidence in South America [10] [11 , 12] , and possibly the US [13] . ZIKV infection in adults has also been strongly linked to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome ( GBS ) and meningoencephalitis [14] . In February 2016 , the World Health Organization declared the Zika virus an international public health emergency , prompted by its link to microcephaly . To date , there are no ZIKV licensed vaccines or antiviral therapies available for treatment . ZIKV envelope glycoproteins have been identified as good candidates for vaccine development , as these have been correlated to the induction of potent ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibodies[15 , 16] . Several approaches are currently being explored to develop a ZIKV vaccine , including inactivated , recombinant live-attenuated viruses , protein subunit vaccines , virus-like particles ( VLPs ) , RNA , and DNA vaccines[17\u201321] . A VLP vaccine approach against ZIKV would eliminate concerns of live attenuated vaccines and insufficient inactivation of killed vaccines for pregnant women and other populations at high risk of suffering the devastating effects of ZIKV infections . In recent years , recombinant VLP-based vaccine strategies have been frequently used for vaccine design . VLPs are empty , non-infectious viral capsids that contain viral proteins . VLPs are known to be highly immunogenic and elicit higher titer neutralizing antibody responses than subunit vaccines based on individual proteins [22] . Such VLPs present viral spikes and other surface components that display linear or conformational epitopes in a repetitive array that effectively results in recognition by B-cells [23] . This recognition leads to B cell signaling and MHC class II up-regulation that facilitates the generation of high titer specific antibodies . VLPs from viruses , including hepatitis B virus , West Nile virus and chikungunya virus , elicit high titer neutralizing antibody responses that contribute to protective immunity in preclinical animal models and in humans [24\u201326] . Here , we report the development of a ZIKVLP vaccine and its evaluation in susceptible interferon AG129 mice , as well a wild-type BALB/c model . Our findings demonstrate the protective efficacy of the ZIKVLP vaccine and highlight the important role that neutralizing antibodies play in protection against ZIKV infection .\nAfrican Green Monkey kidney cells ( Vero ) and Human embryonic kidney 293 ( HEK293 ) were obtained from ATCC ( ATCC; Manassas , VA , USA ) and grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ( FBS; Hyclone , Logan , UT ) , 2 mM L-glutamine , 1 . 5 g/l sodium bicarbonate , 100 U/ml of penicillin , 100 \u03bcg/ml of streptomycin , and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 . ZIKV strain H/PF/2013 ( GenBank:KJ776791 ) , was obtained from Xavier de Lamballerie ( European Virus Archive , Marseille France ) . Virus stocks were prepared by inoculation onto a confluent monolayer of Vero cells . Mice of the 129/Sv background deficient in alpha/beta interferon alpha/beta/gamma ( IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2/IFN-\u03b3 ) receptors ( AG129 mice ) were obtained from B&K Universal Limited ( Hull , England ) and were bred in the pathogen-free animal facilities of the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine . 5-week-old BALB/c mice ( The Jackson Laboratory , Maine , USA ) were used for wild-type vaccination studies . Groups of mixed sex mice were used for all experiments . This study was carried out in strict accordance with recommendations set forth in the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . All animals and animal facilities were under the control of the School of Veterinary Medicine with oversight from the University of Wisconsin Research Animal Resource Center . The protocol was approved by the University of Wisconsin Animal Care and Use Committee ( Approval #V01327 ) . The prM and E genes of ZIKV strain H/PF/2013 with nascent signal sequence were cloned into a pCMV expression vector under the control of a cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) promoter and CMV polyadenylation signal ( pCMV-prM/E , Fig 1 . ) . Endotoxin free , transfection grade DNA was prepared using Maxiprep kit ( Zymo Research , Irvine , CA ) . VLPs were expressed by transfecting 90% confluent monolayers of HEK293 cells in a T-75 flasks with 15\u03bcg of pCMV-prM/E using Fugene HD ( Promega , Madison , WI ) transfection reagent according to manufacturer protocol . The 10 ml supernatant was harvested 72hr after transfection , and clarified by centrifugation at 15 , 000 RCF for 30 min at 4\u00b0 C . Clarified supernatants were layered onto a 20% sucrose cushion and ultra-centrifuged in a SW-28 rotor at 112 , 000 RCF for 3 . 5 hours at 4\u00b0 C . Pellet ( PT ) and supernatant ( SUP . ) fractions at each step were saved for analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blot . Post sucrose cushion PT were resuspended in Phosphate Buffered Saline ( PBS ) pH 7 . 2 . Total protein in VLP preparations was quantified by Bradford assay . VLP specific protein was determined by comparing Zika specific bands on SDS-PAGE gels to known concentrations of BSA using ImageJ software . VLP fractions were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer ( BioRad , Hercules , CA , USA ) and resolved on a 4\u201320% SDS-PAGE gel ( Biorad ) by electrophoresis using a Mini-PROTEAN 3 system ( BIO-RAD , CA ) . Gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes using a Turboblot system . Membranes were blocked in 5% ( W/V ) skim milk and probed with mouse hyper immune ascites fluid primary antibody ( 1:5000 ) and goat anti-mouse HRP conjugated secondary antibody ( 1:5000 ) . Membranes were developed using a solid phase 3 , 3\u2019 , 5 , 5\u2019-tetramethylbenzidine ( TMB ) substrate system . Samples were negatively stained for electron microscopy using the drop method . A drop of sample was placed on a PioloformTM ( Ted Pella , Inc . ) carbon-coated 300 Mesh Cu grid , allowed to adsorb for 30 seconds , and the excess removed with filter paper . Next , a drop of methylamine tungstate or uranyl acetate ( Nano-W , Nanoprobes Inc . ) was placed on the still wet grid , and the excess removed . The negatively stained sample was allowed to dry , and was documented in a Philips CM120 ( Eindhoven , The Netherlands ) transmission electron microscope at 80kV . Images were obtained using a SIS MegaView III digital camera ( Soft Imaging Systems , Lakewood . Colorado ) . Each of the following animal studies was performed as one biological replicate . For VLP formulations , the indicated dose of sucrose cushion purified VLPs was mixed with 0 . 2% Imject Alum ( Thermo Scientific ) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol . Groups of AG129 mice were injected intramuscularly ( IM ) with VLPs mixed with alum ( n = 5 ) or PBS mixed with alum ( n = 6 ) at 6 weeks of age , and again at 8 weeks of age . Sub-mandibular blood draws were performed pre boost and pre challenge to collect serum for analysis by neutralization assays and for passive transfer studies . AG129 mice were challenged with 200 PFU of ZIKV strain H/PF/2013 in 25\u03bcl volumes by intradermal ( ID ) injection into the right hind footpad at 11 weeks of age . BALB/c mice were vaccinated once at 5 weeks of age as above , and challenged at 13 weeks of age with 200 PFU of H/PF/2013 in 50\u03bcl by retro orbital injection ( IV route ) . Following infection , mice were monitored daily for the duration of the study . Mice that were moribund or that lost greater than 20% of starting weight were humanely euthanized . Sub-mandibular blood draws were performed on day two post challenge ( PC ) and serum collected to measure viremia . Eight week old AG129 mice were used for passive transfer studies Five naive mice were injected intraperitoneally ( IP ) with 500\u03bcl of pooled serum from VLP vaccinated , diluted serum ( 1:5 n = 4 , 1:10 , n = 4 ) , or serum from PBS/alum ( n = 5 ) treated mice . At 12h post transfer , mice were challenged with 20 PFU in 25\u03bcl as above . Viremia was determined by TCID50 assay . Briefly , serum was serially diluted ten-fold in microtiter plates and added to duplicate wells of Vero cells in 96-well plates , incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 days , then fixed and stained with 10% ( W/V ) crystal violet in 10% ( V/V ) formalin . Plates were observed under a light microscope to determine the 50% tissue culture infective doses ( TCID50s ) . Serum samples were also tested for viral RNA copies by qRT-PCR . RNA was extracted from 0 . 02ml of serum using the ZR Viral RNA Kit ( Zymo Research , Irvine , CA ) . Viral RNA was quantified by qRT-PCR using the primers and probe designed by Lanciotti et al [52] . The qRT-PCR was performed using the iTaq Universal Probes One-Step Kit ( BioRad , Hercules , CA ) on an iCycler instrument ( BioRad , Hercules , CA ) . Primers and probe were used at final concentrations of 500 nM and 250 nM respectively . Cycling conditions were as follows: 50\u00b0C for 10 min and 95\u00b0C for 2 min , followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 sec and 60\u00b0C for 30 sec . Virus concentration was determined by interpolation onto an internal standard curve made up of a 5-point dilution series of in vitro transcribed RNA , with the lowest copies per reaction being 100 . Serum antibody titers were determined by microneutralization assay . Briefly , serum was incubated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min to inactivate complement and then serially diluted two-fold in microtiter plates . 200 PFUs of virus were added to each well and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1h . The virus-serum mixture was added to duplicate wells of Vero cells in 96-well plates , incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 days , then fixed and stained with 10% ( W/V ) crystal violet in 10% ( V/V ) formalin , then observed under a light microscope . The titer was determined as the serum dilution resulting in the complete neutralization of the virus . Serum samples were serially diluted , mixed with 200 PFU of the ZIKV H/PF/2013 strain and incubated for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C . This serum/virus mixture was added to confluent layers of Vero cells in 96 well plates and incubated for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C , after which the serum/virus mixture was removed and overlay solution ( 3% CMC , 1X DMEM , 2% FBS and 1X Anti/Anti ) was added . After 48 hrs of infection , the monolayers were fixed with 4% PFA , washed twice with PBS , and then incubated with ZIKV hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid ( 1:2000 , UTMB ) diluted in blocking solution ( 1X PBS , 0 . 01% Tween-20 and 5% Milk ) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C . Plates were washed three times with PBS-T and then peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody ( 1:2000 ) was incubated on monolayers for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C . Following incubation , cells were washed a final three times with PBS-T and developed using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole ( AEC ) -peroxidase substrate . The amount of formed foci were counted using an ELISPOT plate reader ( ImmunoSPOT-Cellular Technology ) ; quality control was performed to each scanned well to ensure accurate counting . Neutralization percentages ( Nx ) were calculated per sample/replicate/dilution as follows: Nx={100\u2212[100 ( AControl ) Where A corresponds to the amount of foci counted in the sample and Control is the geometric mean of foci counted from wells treated with cells and virus only . Data of corresponding transformed dilutions ( Log ( 1/Dilution ) ) against neutralization percentages per sample was plotted and fitted to a sigmoidal dose-response curve to interpolate PRNT50 values ( GraphPad Prism software ) .\nTo generate Zika VLPs ( ZIKVLPs ) , we cloned the prM/E genes with native signal sequence into a pCMV expression vector ( pCMV-prM/E ) ( Fig 1A ) , transfected HEK293 cells and harvested supernatants ( supe . ) 3 days post transfection . 78\u03bcg total protein was recovered from post sucrose purification of which 21 . 6 \u03bcg was ZIKVLP protein . Western blot analysis of this pCMV-prM/E supe . revealed expression of a ~50kDa size band ( Fig 1B , lane 2 ) that corresponded in size to the predicted size of the Zika virus E gene , and additionally matched positive control Zika virus stocks ( Fig 1B , lane 3 ) . To test the hypothesis that expression of Zika prM and E genes spontaneously form extracellular particles , supernatants from pCMV-prM/E and pCMV-GFP ( negative control ) transfected cells were centrifuged on a sucrose cushion ( SC ) sufficient for pelleting of flavivirus particles from cell culture proteins [27] . pCMV-prM/E SC purified pellet ( pt . ) appeared to contain high levels of E protein , indicating that staining was specific to expression of prM and E genes . Purity of ZIKVLP preparations was additionally analyzed by SDS-PAGE of VLP preprations , followed by total protein staining , which revealed only major staining at E protein specific bands ( Sup . Fig 1A and 1B ) . Additionally , western blot analysis using monoclonal antibody specific to ZIKA virus E protein revealed E protein at the expected size ( Sup . Fig 2C ) . To determine if the immune reactive extracellular particles were resembled ZIKV , we performed transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) on pCMV-prM/E SC pt . material . TEM revealed structures with similarity to ZIKV and size that ranged from 30-60nm , and an average size of ~50nm ( Fig 1C\u20131E ) . We first determined the LD50 of the H/PF/2013 strain in 12 week-old mixed sex AG129 mice . Groups of mice ( n = 5 ) were infected with 5-fold serial dilutions from 2 PFU to 0 . 02 PFU of ZIKV and monitored for 4 weeks following the last mortality . All mice infected with 2 or 0 . 4PFU died within the first week of challenge ( Fig 2 ) , while lower doses killed only 1 to 2 mice within the first two weeks . Interestingly , 2 mice infected with 0 . 2 PFU ZIKV became ill and were euthanized due to weight loss and paralysis 4 . 5 weeks following challenge . The resultant LD50 value in PFUs was calculated to be 0 . 19 PFU by the Reed-Muench [28] method . To determine if ZIKVLPs are immunogenic and protective in highly susceptible AG129 mice , groups of mice received a prime and boost of 450ng ZIKVLPs . AG129 mice that received ZIKVLPs developed low levels ( GMT = 1:9 . 2 ) of neutralizing antibodies ( nAbs ) at two weeks post administration ( Fig 3A ) , that increased two weeks after boost ( GMT = 1:32 ) . Five weeks after primary vaccination , all mice were challenged with 200 PFU ( >1000LD50s ) of ZIKV by the ID route . Mice administered ZIKVLPs maintained weight , while mice that received PBS/alum experienced significant morbidity throughout the challenge period ( Fig 3B ) . All control mice ( survival 0/6 ) died 9 days after ZIKV challenge and had significantly lower survival ( p = 0 . 0016 ) than mice administered ZIKVLPs ( survival 5/5 , Fig 3B and 3C ) . Finally , ZIKVLPs vaccinated mice had significantly lower levels of viremia on day 2 post challenge than control mice detected by qRT-PCR ( ZIKVLP = 1 . 3x104 RNA copies , PBS/alum 9 . 6x107 RNA copies , p = . 0356 , Fig 3D ) and TCID50 assay ( ZIKVLP = 1 . 3x102 TCID50s , PBS/alum 2 . 8x105 TCID50s p = . 0493 , Fig 3E ) . The plaque reduction neutralization test ( PRNT ) assay is widely considered to be the \u201cgold standard\u201d for characterizing and quantifying circulating levels of anti-dengue and other flaviviral neutralizing antibodies ( nAb ) [29] . We therefore developed and optimized a PRNT assay for rapidly measuring ZIKV specific neutralizing antibodies . Pooled serum samples collected from mice pre-challenge , as well as individual serum samples collected from mice post-challenge were tested by this PRNT assay . Pre challenge , pooled serum from mice administered ZIKVLPs had a calculated 50% plaque reduction ( PRNT50 ) titer of 1:157 . The PRNT50 titer increased 2 weeks post challenge ( GMT = 5122 ) ( Fig 3F ) . To test the role of anti-ZIKV antibodies in protection against challenge , groups of mice received ZIKVLP antiserum ( pooled pre challenge serum , titer in Fig 3F ) , undiluted ( n = 5 ) , diluted 1:5 ( n = 4 ) , or 1:10 ( n = 4 ) . As a negative control , mice ( n = 5 ) were transferred serum from mice previously vaccinated with PBS alum . Negative control mice rapidly lost weight starting after day 7 and all died day 9 post challenge ( Fig 4A and 4B ) . Mice that received undiluted serum maintained weight throughout the 14 day period post challenge , and showed no signs of infection . Mice that received diluted anti-ZIKV antibodies were not protected from challenge , although survival and weight loss were slightly extended relative to negative control mice ( Fig 4A and 4B ) . To determine if a single dose could protect AG129 mice , groups of 6-week old AG129 mice were vaccinated with 3\u03bcg ZIKVLPs adjuvanted with alum . An additional group of mice ( n = 5 ) was vaccinated with a prime and boost of 0 . 45\u03bcg adjuvanted with alum for comparison . Negative control mice ( n = 5 ) received a prime and boost of PBS/alum . Vaccinated mice developed neutralizing antibodies measured by PRNT assay prior to challenge ( Fig 5A ) . Eight weeks following primary vaccination mice were challenged with 200 PFU ( >1000LD50s ) of ZIKV by the ID route . All mice administered a prime of 3\u03bcg or a prime and boost of 0 . 45\u03bcg ZIKVLPs survived throughout the 6 week challenge period ( Fig 5C ) and maintained weight throughout the challenge period . Pre challenge neutralizing antibody titers in both single ( GMT PRNT50 = 288 ) and double dose ( GMT PRNT50 = 235 ) groups increased significantly ( p < . 005 ) in all animals measured at 3 weeks post challenge ( Fig 5A and 5B ) . To determine if ZIKVLPs can protect wildtype BALB/c mice against non-lethal ZIKV challenge , a group ( n = 6 ) was vaccinated with a single dose of 3\u03bcg ZIKVLPs adjuvanted with alum . Negative control mice ( n = 5 ) were administered PBS/alum . Eight weeks after vaccination mice were challenged with 200 PFU ZIKV by the IV route . A single dose of ZIKVLPs elicited high titers of neutralizing antibodies ( PRNT50 = 381 ) detected immediately prior to challenge ( Fig 6A ) . Mice vaccinated with ZIKVLPs were completely protected from viremia on day 2 post challenge ( Fig 6B ) , and maintained weight throughout the challenge period ( Fig 6C ) . Negative control animals lost minor amounts of weight beginning at day 2 post challenge , had high levels of viremia and recovered by 2 weeks post challenge . Neutralizing antibodies were undetectable in negative control mice prior to challenge , but increased significantly after challenge ( Fig 6A ) . Antibody titers in vaccinated mice decreased , but were not significantly different than before ZIKV challenge ( Fig 6A ) . Serum from mice prior to challenge ( 8 weeks post vaccination ) was also analyzed by ELISA . ZIKVLP vaccination induced high levels of IgG1 , IgG2A/B and low levels of IgM relative to mock vaccinated controls at both 2 and 8 weeks following vaccination .\nIn February 2016 , the World Health Organization declared that the recent clusters of microcephaly and other neurological disorders in Brazil constitute a public health emergency of international concern . Their recommendations included enhanced surveillance and research , as well as aggressive measures to reduce infection with Zika virus , particularly amongst pregnant women and women of childbearing age . As of December 2017 , the Zika epidemic has resulted in at least 223 , 336 confirmed cases worldwide with 3 , 715 cases of confirmed congenital syndrome associated with ZIKV infection [30] . The trends in Zika and Guillain-Barre syndrome cases should raise major concerns while at least five countries in the Americas have reported sexually transmitted Zika cases , adding to the list of alarming risk factors . ZIKV is now receiving considerable attention due to its rapid spread in the Americas , and its association with microcephaly [31] and Guillain-Barre syndrome [9] . Since the declaration of this public health emergency , several ZIKV vaccine candidates have been evaluated and even tested in animal models . Producing an effective and safe control strategy against the spread of ZIKV and its associated syndromes is still of high priority . In our studies , we designed a ZIKV-virus-like particle ( VLP ) vaccine , demonstrated expression in vitro by western blot and transmission electron microscopy , and tested the protective efficacy and role of antibodies in protection in the AG129 mouse model . This work provides additional support to previous reports on the value of ZIKV-VLP vaccines [19 , 32] . In comparison to inactivated vaccine formulations , ZIKVLPs induced significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers that reacted to conformational neutralizing epitopes . Our study differs from previous VLP work on several aspects: 1 ) evaluation of single vs multiple vaccine doses; 2 ) role of antibodies on protection using a passive transfer model; and 3 ) efficacy using both immunocompetent ( BALB/c ) and susceptible ( AG129 ) mouse models . Although the transfection and purification procedures for this ZIKVLP have yet to be optimized , we had an overall calculated yield of 2 . 2 mg/L . Similar expression levels have been reported for other flavivirus VLP expression strategies [33] . Future work will optimize VLP production and purification parameters , which should significantly increase both yield and purity . We are currently developing stably transfected HEK cells that continuously express VLPs , which will allow for scalable production to help meet global demand for a ZIKV vaccine , which is estimated to be 100 million doses a year . ZIKVLPs , formulated with alum , induced detectable neutralizing antibodies and protected animals against lethal challenge ( >400 LD50s ) with no morbidity or mortality . Pre-challenge GMT neutralizing titers were 1:32 , and pooled pre-challenge serum PRNT50 titer was 1:157 . At a relatively low dose of 450ng , our results indicate that our ZIKVLPs are highly immunogenic . Initial doses ( 450ng ) were chosen based on available antigen . Since 2 doses of 0 . 45ug did not elicit complete protection in AG129 mice , a single , larger dose ( 3ug ) was chosen to determine if a single dose could provide complete protection in both mouse models . The antibody titers we obtained are consistent with those reported for other highly immunogenic flavivirus VLP vaccines [33 , 34] . Previous work has shown a direct correlation between dose of VLPs and neutralizing antibody titers . For ZIKV , questions remain about the quantitative relationship between dose of VLPs and their effect on neutralizing antibody titers and protection from ZIKV challenge in vivo . In our studies , mice were vaccinated with ZIKVLPs and challenged with a homologous strain of ZIKV ( H/PF/2013 ) , which raises the question of ZIKVLP specific antibody cross reactivity to heterologous viruses currently circulating in the Americas . Although the H/PF/2013 virus was isolated well before the current outbreak from a patient infected in French Polynesia , there is a high degree of amino acid similarity ( ~99% ) to endemic South American strains of ZIKV [35 , 36] . Some experts agree that the high serological cross-reactivity among ZIKV strains would allow for a monovalent vaccine [15] . Nevertheless , care must be taken to empirically determine if antibody responses elicited by ZIKVLPs cross-react and protect against South American strains . Finally , any future ZIKV vaccination programs should incorporate careful surveillance of circulating strains to help suppress immunological escape , and ensure efficacy of vaccines in human populations . Vaccinated AG129 mice challenged with >1000 LD50s had low levels of viremia ( 1 . 3x102 TCID50s , Fig 3E ) detected after challenge . Copies of RNA ZIKV genomes in serum of mice were significantly higher than levels of viremia . However , the disparity between viral genome copies and viremia has been observed for other flaviviruses including dengue [37] . Since AG129 mice are highly susceptible to viral challenge , it is possible that the challenge dose given for the active vaccination study was artificially high . Methods for challenging mice from infected mosquito bite should be developed to most accurately mimic natural infection . The most important criteria for any ZIKV vaccine is its ability to prevent placental and fetal pathology in ZIKV infected pregnant women . Recently developed IFN deficient pregnant mouse models can provide an opportunity to assess if vaccination of pregnant animals can protect the fetus from ZIKV-induced pathology [38] . Although models for ZIKV infection in pregnant non-human primates ( NHP ) are still being developed , ZIKV vaccines should be tested in NHP translational models which most accurately mimics human immune responses to vaccination . A VLP vaccine approach against ZIKV has significant advantages over other technologies as it will eliminate concerns of live attenuated vaccines and insufficient inactivation of killed vaccines for pregnant women and other populations at high risk of suffering the devastating effects of ZIKV infections . Production of inactivated vaccines requires high titer growth of infectious virus which may pose a safety concern for workers . Additionally , the production of both attenuated and inactivated ZIKV vaccines is limited to \u201cbatch\u201d production , whereas flavivirus VLPs can continuously expressed from stable cell lines . In recent years , recombinant virus-like particle ( VLP ) -based vaccine strategies have been frequently used for vaccine design . VLPs are known to be highly immunogenic and elicit higher titer neutralizing antibody responses than subunit vaccines based on individual proteins [39] . The role of neutralizing antibodies in protecting against ZIKV was demonstrated by antibody passive transfer studies as naive AG129 mice receiving pooled serum from VLP vaccinated animals were fully protected . These results are consistent with previous findings that indicate the important role of antibodies in protecting against many insect-borne flaviviruses , such as Japanese encephalitis , west Nile virus , and tick borne encephalitis [40\u201342] , even at low levels of circulating antibodies . In this study , we observed full protection when animals received undiluted serum ( PRNT50 1:157 ) , with no weight loss or other clinical signs observed . At the time of this passive transfer study , we had not finished generated data regarding low doses of ZIKV and mortality past 14 days . However , according to our complete studies [43] , the challenge dose ( 20 PFU ) should have resulted in 100% mortality by day 9 , therefore , all mice challenged and alive through day 14 indicate protection against ZIKV infection . While these studies highlight the importance of serum antibodies in ZIKV protection , there are still many important questions related to ZIKV immunology . What is the minimum antibody titer needed for protection , do ZIKVLPs elicit CD8+ responses and are these responses involved in protection , and what is the overall role of cellular immunity in protection ? It is also important to determine if anti-ZIKV antibodies , particularly those elicited by ZIKVLPs , play any role in dengue protection or disease enhancement . Of note , vaccination with VLPs elicited low levels of IgM relative to IgG1/2 following vaccination , which may be important for compatibility with IgM detection kits for use during pregnancy . In this study we used AG129 IFN receptor-deficient mice . These mouse models are commonly used for the evaluation of arboviral vaccines , including dengue , chikungunya and yellow fever virus [44\u201346] . We recently documented the suitability of mice deficient in IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and -\u03b3 receptors as an animal model for ZIKV , as they are highly susceptible to ZIKV infection and disease , developing rapid viremic dissemination in visceral organs and brain and dying 7\u20138 days post-infection [43] , and evaluated doses as low as 1 PFU . In our current studies , we observed consistent lethality at doses below 1 PFU , indicating that there are viral subpopulations refractory for the formation of CPE in cell culture , but still capable of establishing a lethal infection in highly susceptible mice . It is of great interest is that at a very low dose ( 0 . 2 PFU ) two of five mice became ill more than 1 month after infection , as infection with ZIKV typically produces rapid lethality in AG129 mice . Our current studies challenged mice with 200 PFU at 11 weeks of age . All control mice lost 20% weight , were moribund , and succumbed to by challenge by day 9 . ZIKV challenge therefore appears to be completely lethal in both juvenile and adult AG129 mice . The AG129 mouse model exhibits an intact adaptive immune system , despite the lack of an IFN response , and it has been used extensively to evaluate vaccines and antivirals for DENV [47\u201350] . In our studies WT BALB/c mice did not succumb to infection with ZIKV consistent with previous studies where BALB/c mice were experimentally inoculated with 200 PFU of ZIKV [51] . Mice also developed high levels of viremia following IV inoculation . A single dose of VLPs prevented detection of viral RNA copies in serum of vaccinated mice at 2 days post infection\u2013when viremia levels typically peak in the BALB/c model . It is possible that viral replication was completely inhibited , as there was no \u201cboost\u201d response in neutralizing antibodies observed following challenge . Finally , in repeat AG129 , and BALB/c mice mouse studies , animals were protected from ZIKV challenge 8 weeks after vaccination . ZIKVLP therefore appear to elicit a potent \u201cmemory\u201d response . In the present study , we used aluminum hydroxide ( commonly known as alum ) as the adjuvant for ZIKVLP preparations . Since its first use in 1932 , vaccines containing aluminum-based adjuvants have been successfully administered in humans demonstrating excellent safety . We intend to examine a variety of adjuvant formulations and optimize their immunogenic potential for our ZIKVLP c", "output": " In a recent study, researchers have developed a vaccine for the Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne disease that can cause severe birth defects when contracted during pregnancy. The vaccine, called Zika virus-like particles (ZIKVLPs), was tested in mice and found to be highly effective in protecting the animals against ZIKV infection.\n\nZIKV is a virus that is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, rash, and joint pain. However, when contracted during pregnancy, ZIKV can lead to serious birth defects, such as microcephaly, a condition characterized by an abnormally small head and underdeveloped brain. There are currently no vaccines or antiviral treatments available for ZIKV.\n\nTo develop the ZIKVLP vaccine, the researchers used a technique called virus-like particle (VLP) technology. VLPs are empty, non-infectious viral capsids that contain viral proteins. They are known to be highly immunogenic, meaning they stimulate a strong immune response, and elicit higher titer neutralizing antibody responses than subunit vaccines based on individual proteins.\n\nThe researchers first cloned the prM/E genes of ZIKV, which encode for the structural proteins of the virus, into a pCMV expression vector. They then transfected human embryonic kidney cells with this vector and harvested the supernatant, which contained the ZIKVLPs. The ZIKVLPs were purified using a sucrose cushion and were found to be highly immunogenic in mice.\n\nThe researchers tested the ZIKVLP vaccine in two different mouse models: AG129 mice, which are deficient in interferon and are highly susceptible to ZIKV infection, and wild-type BALB/c mice. The mice were vaccinated with the ZIKVLPs and then challenged with ZIKV. All of the vaccinated mice survived the challenge, while all of the control mice either died or had increased viremia (viral infection in the blood). The researchers also found that the ZIKVLP vaccine induced the production of neutralizing antibodies, which are antibodies that can neutralize the virus and prevent infection.\n\nThe researchers also demonstrated the protective efficacy of the ZIKVLP vaccine by performing passive transfer studies, in which they transferred serum from vaccinated mice to naive mice. The naive mice were then challenged with ZIKV and all of them survived, indicating that the neutralizing antibodies in the serum were able to protect the mice against infection.\n\nOverall, the study demonstrates the protective efficacy of the ZIKVLP vaccine and highlights the important role that neutralizing antibodies play in protection against ZIKV infection. The researchers believe that the ZIKVLP vaccine could be a valuable tool in controlling the spread of ZIKV and preventing the birth defects that can result from infection during pregnancy.", "topic": "Zika virus", "cat": []}
{"input": "Brazil is the only country in Latin America that has adopted a national health system . This causes differences in access to health among Latin American countries and induces noticeable migration to Brazilian regions to seek healthcare . This phenomenon has led to difficulties in the control and elimination of diseases related to poverty , such as leprosy . The aim of this study was to evaluate social determinants and their relationship with the risk of leprosy , as well as to examine the temporal trend of its occurrence in a Brazilian municipality located on the tri-border area between Brazil , Paraguay and Argentina . This ecological study investigated newly-diagnosed cases of leprosy between 2003 and 2015 . Exploratory analysis of the data was performed through descriptive statistics . For spatial analysis , geocoding of the data was performed using spatial scan statistic techniques to obtain the Relative Risk ( RR ) for each census tract , with their respective 95% confidence intervals calculated . The Bivariate Moran I test , Ordinary Least Squares ( OLS ) and Geographically Weighted Regression ( GWR ) models were applied to analyze the spatial relationships of social determinants and leprosy risk . The temporal trend of the annual coefficient of new cases was obtained through the Prais-Winsten regression . A standard error of 5% was considered statistically significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Of the 840 new cases identified in the study , there was a predominance of females ( n = 427 , 50 . 8% ) , of white race/color ( n = 685 , 81 . 6% ) , age range 15 to 59 years ( n = 624 , 74 . 3% ) , and incomplete elementary education ( n = 504 , 60 . 0% ) . The results obtained from multivariate analysis revealed that the proportion of households with monthly nominal household income per capita greater than 1 minimum wage ( \u03b2 = 0 . 025 , p = 0 . 036 ) and people of brown race ( \u03b2 = -0 . 101 , p = 0 . 024 ) were statistically-significantly associated with risk of illness due to leprosy . These results also confirmed that social determinants and risk of leprosy were significantly spatially non-stationary . Regarding the temporal trend , a decrease of 4% ( 95% CI [-0 . 053 , -0 . 033] , p = 0 . 000 ) per year was observed in the rate of detection of new cases of leprosy . The social determinants income and race/color were associated with the risk of leprosy . The study\u2019s highlighting of these social determinants can contribute to the development of public policies directed toward the elimination of leprosy in the border region .\nLeprosy is a chronic , disabling infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae , an intracellular bacillus that attacks Schwann cells ( cells of the peripheral nervous system ) causing their destruction and leading to severe neuropathies that cause deformities and physical disabilities [1\u20134] . Leprosy , an endemic member of the neglected diseases group [5] , mainly affects developing countries , constituting a serious global public health problem . In 2015 , the global leprosy detection rate was 3 . 2 cases per 100 , 000 inhabitants , with 16 countries accounting for 92% of all cases of the disease . India , Brazil and Indonesia reported more than 10 , 000 cases , comprising 81% of new cases of the disease during the period [6] . Brazil is the country with the second highest number of cases ( surpassed only by India ) , with a detection rate of 14 . 06 cases per 100 , 000 inhabitants in 2015 [7] . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has launched the Global Leprosy Strategy 2016\u20132020 , which aims \u201cAccelerating towards a leprosy-free world\u201d , which aims to detect leprosy early and provide immediate treatment to prevent disability and reduce transmission of the disease in the community [8] . This strategy aims to reduce the prevalence of leprosy by improving the capacity of health services to diagnose cases in the early stages of the disease , to provide timely treatment aimed at a cure , and to eliminate sources of infection [9] . One of the main obstacles in the elimination of leprosy concerns the social inequalities faced by people in developing countries , caused by poor housing conditions , low levels of education , low incomes , deficits in health services , and migration to urban centers [10 , 11] . Endemic areas with unhealthy housing conditions lacking basic sanitation , human agglomeration , the sharing of collective spaces , especially dormitories with shared beds and sleeping nets , are risk factors for the transmissibility and development of the disease [12 , 13] . So , understanding the social determinants that influence the risk of leprosy transmission is of fundamental importance for the development of actions and strategies that aim to accelerate the process of elimination of the disease in Brazil [14] . For the WHO [14] social determinants of health include individual behaviors and living and working conditions , as well as the relationship between the economic , cultural and social structure . Chaptini & Marshman , based on this premise , grouped social determinants into three dimensions , these being socioeconomic , environmental , and gender determinants [10] . A review of the literature , using the descriptors \u201csocial determinants\u201d and \u201cleprosy\u201d , found few studies with this focus in Brazil . Among the studies that proposed to test the relationship between social determinants and leprosy risk [15\u201318] , none were found that considered spatial dependence or incorporated it into their analysis . By definition , spatial dependence is understood to be the tendency that the value of a variable associated with a particular location resembles the value of its neighboring samples more than the rest of the locations of the sample set; it also becomes the concept of neighborhood , which is formulated on the basis of the property of proximity , in which the events that are closer together tend to be more similar to each other than distant events [19] . Thus , a case of leprosy in a given region tends to influence the epidemiological situation of its neighbors , therefore not being a random event . The quantification and appropriate use of methodologies to deal with this characteristic are also considered to be a knowledge gap , since the majority of traditional epidemiological studies tend to ignore this effect . There is also a lack of studies in border areas of Brazil , where these diseases tend to be more critical or more difficult to control due to the fragility of the services in monitoring the dynamics or migration of populations between the different countries [20] . Therefore , this study aimed to analyze social determinants and their relationship to the risk of contracting illness due to leprosy , as well as the temporal trends of leprosy cases in a tri-border region in Latin America .\nThis was an ecological study [13] . The municipality of Foz do Igua\u00e7u , is on the triple border between Brazil , Paraguay , and Argentina ( Fig 1 ) , situated in the extreme west of Paran\u00e1 , it has a total area of 618 , 353 km2 , being the seventh most populous city in the state . It is organized in 327 census tracts , 320 in the urban area and seven in the rural area . The population of the municipality of Foz do Igua\u00e7u is approximately 263 , 915 inhabitants , with 99 . 2% of the population residing in the urban area [21] . Table 1 presents the main socioeconomic information regarding the municipality . It reveals important social indicators , such as an equality of income distribution of 0 . 545 , which represents an unequal income distribution , and a human development index of 0 . 751 , close to the national average . A critical social condition observed was that only 75 . 3% of the households had an adequate sewage system [21] , which constitutes a risk factor for leprosy [10] . In the context of healthcare , Foz do Igua\u00e7u has 388 health facilities; 61 public , 321 private , and six non-profit institutions . The Municipality has 30 Primary Health Units ( some with a Family Health Strategy ) , 25 specialized clinics/outpatient clinics , two emergency care units , three psychosocial care centers , 46 diagnostic and therapeutic support units , 10 mobile units , 44 polyclinics , four hospitals , two Health Surveillance Units and one central laboratory [22] . This comprised cases of leprosy ( International Statistical Classification\u2014ICD 10 from A30 . 0 to A30 . 9 ) that were diagnosed between 2003 and 2015 and residents of the urban area of the city . The study variables selected were diagnosis date , date of birth , sex , race/color , level of schooling , address , new case ( yes or no ) , pregnancy , clinical form , operational classification ( paucibacillary or multibacillary ) , number of skin injuries , and disability grade at diagnosis ( 0 , I and II ) and at cure ( 0 , I and II ) . These variables were obtained through the Disease Notification Information System ( SINAN ) . Regarding the social determinants , data from the Demographic Census of Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics ( IBGE ) were used . These included general characteristics of the household and people , personal income , household income , color/race , age , gender , and level of schooling . Following the theoretical framework of Chaptini and Marshman [10] , the social determinants were grouped into three dimensions: Data were gathered from the Health Surveillance Department of the Health Bureau in Foz do Igua\u00e7u , Brazil . Exploratory data analysis was performed using Statistica version 12 . 0 , Software , calculating absolute and relative frequencies for the categorical variables , such as sex , schooling , race , operational classification , clinical form and degree of disability at diagnosis . The continuous variables age and number of lesions were categorized according literature [4 , 8 , 9] . The number of cutaneous lesions were classified following the criteria defined by WHO [8] , in other words up to five lesions the authors considered paucibacillary and more than five lesions were classified as multibacillary . The incidence rate was estimated considering the number of cases in the population in the middle of year . This was multiplied by the time of observation ( the 'risk period' , 13 years in this case ) [7] . The size of population was obtained from IBGE - https://www . ibge . gov . br/ . The technique of georeferencing new cases of leprosy by geographic coordinates , according to the address of the residence , was applied . In order to obtain geographic information latitude and longitude , Google Earth Pro open access software was used considering the UTM ( Universal Transverse Mercator ) projections for South America ( SAD/69\u2014South American 1969 UTM zone 20s ) . After conversion of the database to CSV ( Comma-separated values ) format and its configuration , TerraView version 4 . 2 . 2 software was used for the geocoding itself , which corresponds to the linear interpolation of the complete address , to a point in the corresponding segment of the street . Cases with incomplete addresses were excluded from the study . Thematic maps were produced through the digital mesh in the Shapefile extension of the census tracts provided by IBGE . ArcGis version 10 . 5 software was used for this analysis . The relative risk ( RR ) , or risk of illness due to leprosy , for each census tract was obtained through the Spatial Scan Statistic [23] , using the discrete Poisson model , with age and sex as covariables through SatScan version 9 . 3 software . In this analysis it was defined a window of 50% of the population at risk with the statistical significance tested for 999 interactions . The risk was estimated within a grouping divided by the estimated risk outside and within a given area , calculated based on the expression [24]: RR=c/E[c] ( C\u2212c ) / ( E[C]\u2212E[c]=c/E[c] ( C\u2212c ) / ( C\u2212E[c] ( 1 ) Where , c is the number of cases observed within the cluster and C is the total number of cases in the data set E[C] = C , with the analysis being conditioned to a total number of observed cases . The thematic maps were developed in ArcGis version 10 . 5 software . Investigation of the spatial dependence of the social determinants and of the risk of illness due to leprosy was carried out by calculating the Global Moran I Index , using GeoDa 1 . 6 software . This analysis shows the degree of spatial autocorrelation , where the values vary from -1 to 1; positive values indicate direct correlation and negative values inverse correlation , i . e . , dissimilarity among neighbors; the value zero indicates that there is no spatial dependence . The Global Moran I Index was obtained using the formula [25]: I=\u2211i=1n\u2211j=1nwij ( zi\u2212z\u00af ) ( zj\u2212z\u00af ) \u2211i=1n ( zi\u2212z\u00af ) 2 ( 2 ) With n representing the number of areas , zi the value of the variable considered in the area i , z the mean value of the variable in the study region , zj the value of the variable considered in the area z , and wij the neighborhood matrix ( matrix by \u201cqueen\u201d type contiguity ) . In this type of matrix , units with common boundaries or vertices are defined as neighbors , the neighboring unit being defined as wij = 1 , while elements that have no neighborhood relation are defined as wij = 0 [25] . To test the association between social determinants and the risk of illness due to leprosy , the authors used bivariate Global Moran followed by multivariate analysis for the variable statistically significant in the first phase . Calculations of the bivariate Moran index were performed using the GeoDa 1 . 6 software and the permutation of the neighboring attributes approach was used in evaluating significance , as described by Anselin [26] . In the multivariate analysis , the Ordinary Least Squares ( OLS ) regression was considered initially , in an attempt to explain the global relations between social determinants and risk . The diagnoses of an OLS model were followed by examination of multicollinearity and the residuals , quantifying the Variance Inflation Factor ( VIF ) values , and in cases where VIF was higher than 10 , this indicated multicollinearity . The GWR local model was used to analyze the relationship between social determinants and risk of illness due to leprosy for each area ( census tract ) . This technique consisted of a localized multivariate regression that allows to make an estimate of the parameters of a regression and then how they have changed and ranged locally [27] . The adaptive kernel was chosen in this phase . The adjusted coefficient of determination ( Adjusted R2 ) and Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC ) obtained for OLS and corrected Akaike Information Criterion ( AICc ) calculated for GWR were used to compare the OLS and GWR models according to the procedure carried out by Lin and Wen ( 2011 ) . All these analyses were performed using ESRI ArcGis 10 . 5 . 1 and R 3 . 4 . 2 software . For the determination of the temporal trend , the annual incidence coefficient of leprosy was considered as the predictive variable ( Y ) and the time ( year ) the outcome variable ( X ) . The annual incidence coefficient was converted into a logarithm , which provides the reduction of the heterogeneity of the residual variance of the linear regression analysis [28] . Temporal trend analysis was performed through the Prais-Winsten regression [28] , based on the coefficients of annual detection of new cases of leprosy in the period studied . The confidence interval of 95% ( 95% CI ) was used , which results in the Annual Rate of Increase ( ARI ) [29] . The rate trend was classified as increasing , stable or decreasing . In a rate with a positive value , the time series was considered to be increasing . A negative rate was considered to be decreasing and when there was no significant difference between the value and zero it was considered to be stationary . These analyses were performed using Stata version 13 software . For all tests in the study , Type I error was set at 5% ( p < 0 . 05 ) statistical significance . The Research Ethics Committee of EERP/USP , based on the Directives and Norms Regulating Research with Human Subjects , Resolution 196/96 of the National Health Council , approved the study under authorization No . 59299816 . 2 . 0000 . 5393 issued on 10th September 2016 . All data analyzed were anonymized .\nA total of 840 new cases of leprosy were identified , of which 427 ( 50 . 8% ) were females , 685 ( 81 . 6% ) were white race/color , 624 ( 74 . 3% ) were people between 15 and 59 years of age , and 504 ( 60% ) were those with incomplete high school education ( Table 2 ) . Regarding the operational classification in Table 2 , 648 cases ( 77 . 2% ) were multibacillary and 192 ( 22 . 8% ) were paucibacillary . The predominant clinical form was dimorphic ( n = 464 , 55 . 2% ) , followed by the lepromatous form ( n = 183 , 21 . 8% ) . With regard to the number of cutaneous lesions , 441 ( 52 . 5% ) had five or fewer lesions and 342 ( 40 . 7% ) had more than five cutaneous lesions , with a zero degree of disability ( n = 466 , 55 . 5% ) . Of the 840 cases included in the study , 765 cases were geocoded ( 91% ) . Of the excluded cases , 50 did not have a full address and 25 cases were not located through the Google Earth Pro open access software . Table 3 presents the spatial statistics values obtained through the Univariate and Bivariate Global Moran I Test ( BMI ) ; following the theoretical framework of the study , it can be observed that the determinants were divided into socioeconomic , environmental and gender determinants . The Table 3 shows all variables were statistically associated with risk of illness due to leprosy . Table 4 shows the results obtained from multivariate analysis applying Weighted OLS Regression , where the variables proportion of households with monthly nominal household income per capita greater than 1 minimum wage ( \u03b2 = 0 . 025 , p = 0 . 036 ) and proportion of people of brown race ( \u03b2 = -0 . 101 , p = 0 . 024 ) were statistically significant associated with risk of illness due to leprosy . Fig 2 shows the maps obtained through GWR analysis . From this figure it is possible to observe the distribution of R2 and \u03b2 of the variables . The results of GWR are really clear in the map and confirmed the GWR ( R2 = 0 . 25; R2Adjusted = 0 . 16 ) was more suitable than the OLS model ( R2 = 0 . 09; R2Adjusted = 0 . 08 ) since GWR explained 16 percent of the total model variation with the decreased AIC ( 1289 . 4 ) . Fig 2A shows the relative risk for tuberculosis , whereas the variables proportion of households with monthly nominal household income per capita greater than 1 minimum wage ( %INPC > 1 ) and proportion of people of brown race ( %BRACE ) are shown respectively in Fig 2B and 2C . The spatial variations in parameter estimates ( \u03b2 ) for variables proportion of households with monthly nominal household income per capita greater than 1 minimum wage ( \u03b2INPC > 1 ) and proportion of people of brown race ( \u03b2BRACE ) are shown respectively in Fig 2E and 2F . Fig 2E demonstrates that negative coefficients values ranged from -0 . 12 to 0 . 23 , from which it is evident that the risk is lower or nonexistent in areas where the income is higher than 1 minimum wage . Turning to Fig 2F , the parameters were from -0 . 04 to 0 . 35 , which means there is a positive value in association of brown race to risk of illness due to leprosy . Table 5 presents the results of the temporal trend , as revealed through the Prais-Winsten regression , in the annual detection rate of new cases of leprosy . Fig 3 shows a decrease in the detection rate of new cases of leprosy ( 4 . 3% per year ) over the 13-year time series form 2003 to 2015 .\nThe aim of this study was to analyze social determinants and their relationship with the risk of illness due to leprosy , as well as the temporal trends of leprosy cases in a region of the tri-border region in Latin America . Income and brown race were found to be determinants associated with the risk of leprosy . There was also a decreasing trend in the detection of leprosy in the region of the study , of the order of 4 . 3% in the period investigated , which was found to be significant , using the Prais-Winsten regression . Initial exploratory analysis of the data revealed that there was a predominance of patients of white race/color , in the age group of 15 to 59 years and in those with incomplete elementary education . These results are similar to those found in other Brazilian studies [20 , 30\u201335] . Regarding age , the majority of the patients were in the economically-active age group , which is of concern , since the non-diagnosis of the disease can lead to the development of lesions and further evolve into disabilities and reactional states , which may impact on the family , and wider local , economy [9] . Patients under 15 years of age were also observed in the patient population ( n = 29 , 3 . 4% ) ; this is a serious finding that indicates delayed leprosy diagnosis ( high bacillary burden , without treatment ) and a possible failure in primary care [5 , 8 , 12 , 36 , 37] . It is interesting to compare this result with Table 4 , where the leprosy detection rate was identified as decreasing in the region since 2003 . Therefore it is likely that cases of disease are underreported , or not found , by the health care system , which might be due to a weakness of Primary Health Care in active case-finding and decentralization to general practitioners without support from a reference center for the diagnosis and treatment of leprosy [38] . This epidemiological situation is evidence that Brazil is really far from achieving the goal of WHO\u2019s \u201cGlobal Strategy for Leprosy 2016\u20132020\u201d , which aims for zero children diagnosed with leprosy and visible deformities [8] . Also according to the results , most of the patients had incomplete elementary education , which is an important characteristic also found by Chaptini and Marshman [10 , 18 , 36] whose studies reported that low levels of literacy are associated with higher rates of leprosy . This relationship is due to a reduction in seeking and understanding clinical information regarding the disease and an association with low income . Santos , Castro and Falqueto [39] also found that people with low levels of education have greater difficulty in accessing health services and understanding health promotion actions and disease prevention measures . Regarding the operational classification of leprosy , the multibacillary form , the most infectious form of the disease , was observed predominantly . This may indicate late diagnosis of the disease in the study region , contributing to the leprosy transmission chain and to the increase in the degree of physical disabilities [2 , 9] . A prevalence of the multibacillary classification has also been reported in other studies [30 , 34 , 35 , 40 , 41] . Regarding the association between social determinants and risk of illness due to leprosy , it was possible to detect a negative association with the proportion of households with monthly nominal household income per capita greater than 1 minimum wage . This finding has been confirmed by other studies [24 , 42\u201346] . One important issue that has been shown by the literature is that income is a social protection factor in the development of neglected diseases that are related to poverty , such as leprosy [47] . It can clearly be observed in Fig 2C , where the relation between higher income and lower risk of leprosy is expressed , represented in the dark red color in the mapping . Chaptini and Marshman [10] stated that leprosy is associated with poverty due to a multiplicity of factors , including the effect of lower income and unemployment which reduces access to health services to purchase necessary medicines , poorer housing , and overcrowding of homes . Another aspect that is linked to low income is access to adequate food , since poor nutrition is related to an increased risk of developing leprosy [12 , 48] . Through multivariate analysis it was found that areas with a predominance of people with brown race/color presented an increased risk for leprosy , which demonstrates the relationship of this disease with this social determinant . Castro et al . [49] also found a correlation between race/color and the risk of the occurrence of leprosy . Biologically there is no evidence that color/ race is a risk for the development of leprosy ( 36 ) , however in Brazil these characteristics are more related to social inequality . Due to reasons of history , people of brown race/color have less access to elementary school , high school and higher education; they have lower income when compared to white people and also fewer opportunities to participate in formal work , and to live in houses with basic sanitation [50] . However , there is a strong politics of \u201cquota\u201d ( affirmative action ) in Brazil to improve the access of these people in an attempt to give underprivileged people better chances of getting free higher education and thus access to better opportunities . The politics of quota in Brazil addressed to color/race have changed in recent years , and class criteria have become more acceptable than race for reducing Brazil\u2019s social and racial inequalities , however there is much discussion about the appropriate policy solutions for the problem [51] . This study may contribute with this debate once it is evidenced that areas with a higher proportion of brown race/color patients have a higher risk of leprosy . It is important to highlight that the characteristics of the space where these people are living is what is associated to the leprosy risk , which means that is not necessarily these individuals are getting sick or have been affected by the disease . The association was found in the ecological level , a phenomenon that is classically known as ecological fallacy . The results also show a decrease of 4% per year in the rate of detection of new cases of leprosy , which is similar throughout the entire state of Paran\u00e1 [22 , 52] . This result leads to the question of whether the apparent decrease reflects the actual epidemiological situation of leprosy or possible underreporting . Considering the social inequalities that increase the risk of leprosy found in the study , the second hypothesis is more likely to be confirmed . Because it is a border region , where there is a major flow of people between the three countries , the control of communicable diseases is highly complex . It is difficult to precisely determine the areas of risk due to the very dynamism of this population [20 , 54 , 55] . However , the study advances knowledge by highlighting the social determinants of the risk of leprosy , serving as a reference for future studies that include spatial dependence in their structure , notably those that test relationships between social determinants and diseases of poverty , such as leprosy . The elimination of leprosy goes beyond merely knowing what the social determinants of leprosy are , and medical technology for diagnosis and treatment will only have an impact if there are significant advances in social areas . Although there have been improvements in social conditions in Brazil , due to large investment in government programs , this has not yet been enough to overcome the sanitary conditions where leprosy is spread . Control of the disease includes the dimensions of sanitation , living conditions and income , as well as the inequalities that still exist among people of the brown race/color and lower income , as , according to the findings of this study , they are at higher risk of illness due to leprosy . Inclusion policies can be a measure to reduce the differences in risk . Latin America achieved a detection rate of about 2 . 7 new cases per 100 , 000 inhabitants , taking second position in the world in terms of cases numbers . Brazil was included in the priority list for leprosy elimination , even though the number of cases detected has substantially decreased during the last decade . It is important to emphasize that in Latin America , Brazil presents the largest number of cases ( 25 , 218 ) followed by Paraguay ( 341 ) and Argentina ( 295 ) [56] . An issue is the migration between these countries likely influences in leprosy incidence and prevalence in the region studied , however it was not possible to estimate its impact due to data from Paraguay and Argentina were not available . The study has shown that leprosy is spatially determined , this being relevant for studies that aim to understand the dynamics of the disease using more robust methodologies , mainly through GWR , which resulted in better models than traditional methods ( OLS ) . The study advances knowledge about the distribution of the disease in the tri-border region of Brazil , Paraguay and Argentina , presenting evidence for improvement in health policies for control of the disease . Castro et al . [49] reinforce the associative nature of the disease and social inequality , demonstrating that leprosy is not limited to illness process individual , but essentially from social factors accumulated in the life course of a population , since intrauterine growth until later adult life , which is really complex to analyze in a single study . Other issue is that leprosy is not limited to social stressor factors within a single generation but should intertwine biological and social transmission of risk across generations , which also requires more complex and dynamics approach . For future study , it would be interesting to develop a prospective study and also including data from Paraguay and Argentina through a data collect in loco . The inclusion of data from both countries was not possible because all their registers were still handwritten , they do not use computerized systems for monitoring leprosy cases . Based on the findings of the study , it can be concluded that the leprosy elimination strategy must transcend the technological apparatus of the health sector , which is often focused on diagnostic technology and treatment , and must include essential aspects of human development and welfare . The study contains limitations related to the use of the secondary data obtained from SINAN , which may present data instability and incompleteness due to failures to complete the data in the notification form . Another limitation was the difficulty in selecting the variables related to social determinants , these were based on the literature [10 , 15 , 43 , 45 , 53] but the number of studies using such an approach for leprosy is still limited . The methodology also addresses the issue of areas identified as protection actually being areas of underreporting .", "output": " This study, conducted in the tri-border region between Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina, aimed to analyze social determinants and their relationship with the risk of contracting leprosy, a chronic and disabling infectious disease that mainly affects developing countries. The study found that income and race/color were significant determinants associated with the risk of leprosy.\n\nThe researchers used an ecological study design and investigated newly-diagnosed cases of leprosy between 2003 and 2015 in the Brazilian municipality of Foz do Igua\u00e7u. They found that areas with a higher proportion of households with monthly nominal household income per capita greater than 1 minimum wage had a lower risk of leprosy, while areas with a predominance of people of brown race/color presented an increased risk.\n\nThe study also revealed a decreasing trend in the detection of leprosy in the region, with a decrease of 4.3% per year over the 13-year time series. However, the researchers noted that this decrease may reflect underreporting of cases, as the non-diagnosis of the disease can lead to the development of lesions and further evolve into disabilities.\n\nThe findings of this study highlight the importance of addressing social determinants, such as income and race/color, in efforts to eliminate leprosy. The study's findings can contribute to the development of public policies directed toward the elimination of leprosy in the border region, as well as inform future studies that include spatial dependence in their structure. The study also emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to leprosy elimination that goes beyond medical technology for diagnosis and treatment and includes essential aspects of human development and welfare.", "topic": "Leprosy", "cat": []}
